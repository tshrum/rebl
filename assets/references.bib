  abstract = {Objective To determine the multidimensionality of acceptance of spinal cord injury (SCI). Participants Adults with SCI who were admitted to an SCI centre between 1991 and 2020. Methods All eligible participants (n=686) were invited to complete a survey via REDCap. A 4-dimensional model was hypothesized, which included ``Accepting Reality'', ``Value Change'', ``Letting Go of Control'' and ``Behavioural Engagement''. Items from 3 acceptance scales were selected to collectively reflect these 4 dimensions: (i) Spinal Cord Lesion-related Coping Strategies Questionnaire, (ii) Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced, and (iii) a modified Acceptance and Action Questionnaire. A split-sample principal component analysis (PCA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) approach was used. Results Complete data were provided by 431 participants (62.8\%). A PCA on sub-sample one suggested a 4-factor model based on eigenvalues {$\geq$} 1, corresponding to the hypothesized model of acceptance. A CFA on sub-sample 2 showed good model fit, adding further support to the model. Conclusion These findings suggest that acceptance is a multidimensional construct with 4 facets that represent distinct, but interconnected, psychological processes. This model of acceptance can be used as a framework for future research and clinical practice to deepen our understanding of acceptance processes following severe injuries, such as SCI.},

  abstract = {Abstract The U.S. tornado record is subject to inhomogeneities that are due to inconsistent practices in counting tornadoes, assessing their damage, and measuring pathlength and path width. Efforts to improve the modern tornado record (1950--2012) have focused on the following: 1) the rationale for removing the years 1950--52, 2) identification of inconsistencies in F0, F1, and F2 counts based on implementation of the Fujita scale (F scale) and Doppler radar, 3) overestimation of backward-extrapolated F-scale intensity, and 4) a change in path-width reporting from mean width (1953--94) to maximum width (1995--2012). Unique adjustments to these inconsistencies are made by analyzing trends in tornado counts, comparing with previous studies, and making an upward adjustment of tornadoes classified by mean width to coincide with those classified by maximum width. Such refinements offer a more homogeneous tornado record and provide the opportunity to better evaluate climatological trends in significant (F/EF2--F/EF5) tornado activity. The median EF-scale (enhanced Fujita scale) wind speeds Vmed have been adopted for all significant tornadoes from 1953 to 2012, including an adjustment for overestimated intensities from 1953 to 1973. These values are used to calculate annual mean kinetic energy, which shows no apparent trend. The annual mean maximum path width from 1953 to 2012 (adjusted upward from 1953 to 1994 to obtain a common lower threshold), however, displays an increasing trend. Also, the EF-scale median wind speeds are highly correlated with . The quantity (Vmed {\texttimes} PWmax)2 is proposed as a tornado destruction index, and, when calculated as an annual cumulative value, the three largest years are 2007, 2008, and 2011.},

Other relevant research findings since the initial issuance of the taxonomy are also considered and incorporated, where appropriate, to help improve the classification system.

Here, we argue that within coupled human-water systems, drought must be defined and understood as a process as opposed to a product to help better frame and describe the complex and interrelated dynamics of both natural and human-induced changes that define anthropogenic drought as a compound multidimensional and multiscale phenomenon, governed by the combination of natural water variability, climate change, human decisions and activities, and altered micro-climate conditions due to changes in land and water management. This definition considers the full spectrum of dynamic feedbacks and processes (e.g., land-atmosphere interactions and water and energy balance) within human-nature systems that drive the development of anthropogenic drought. This process magnifies the water supply demand gap and can lead to water bankruptcy, which will become more rampant around the globe in the coming decades due to continuously growing water demands under compounding effects of climate change and global environmental degradation. This challenge has de facto implications for both short-term and long-term water resources planning and management, water governance, and policymaking. Herein, after a brief overview of the anthropogenic drought concept and its examples, we discuss existing research gaps and opportunities for better understanding, modeling, and management of this phenomenon.},

We provide evidence that different ways of defining, identifying, and handling outliers alter substantive research conclusions. Then, we report results of a literature review of 46 methodological sources (i.e., journal articles, book chapters, and books) addressing the topic of outliers, as well as 232 organizational science journal articles mentioning issues about outliers. Our literature review uncovered (a) 14 unique and mutually exclusive outlier definitions, 39 outlier identification techniques, and 20 different ways of handling outliers; (b) inconsistencies in how outliers are defined, identified, and handled in various methodological sources; and (c) confusion and lack of transparency in how outliers are addressed by substantive researchers. We offer guidelines, including decision-making trees, that researchers can follow to define, identify, and handle error, interesting, and influential (i.e., model fit and prediction) outliers. Although our emphasis is on regression, structural equation modeling, and multilevel modeling, our general framework forms the basis for a research agenda regarding outliers in the context of other data-analytic approaches. Our recommendations can be used by authors as well as journal editors and reviewers to improve the consistency and transparency of practices regarding the treatment of outliers in organizational science research.},

  abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, Ajzen, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.},

  abstract = {Conceptual and methodological ambiguities surrounding the concept of perceived behavioral control are clarified. It is shown that perceived control over performance of a behavior, though comprised of separable components that reflect beliefs about self-efficacy and about controllability, can nevertheless be considered a unitary latent variable in a hierarchical factor model. It is further argued that there is no necessary correspondence between self-efficacy and internal control factors, or between controllability and external control factors. Self-efficacy and controllability can reflect internal as well as external factors and the extent to which they reflect one or the other is an empirical question. Finally, a case is made that measures of perceived behavioral control need to incorporate self-efficacy as well as controllability items that are carefully selected to ensure high internal consistency. Summary and Conclusions Perceived control over performance of a behavior can account for consider- able variance in intentions and actions. However, ambiguities surrounding the concept of perceived behavioral control have tended to create uncertainties and to impede progress. The present article attempted to clarify conceptual ambiguities and resolve issues related to the operationalization of perceived behavioral control. Recent research has demonstrated that the overarching concept of perceived behavioral control, as commonly assessed, is comprised of two components: self-efficacy (dealing largely with the ease or difficulty of performing a behavior) and controllability (the extent to which performance is up to the actor). Contrary to a widely accepted view, it was argued that self-efficacy expectations do not necessarily correspond to beliefs about internal control factors, and that controllability expectations have no necessary basis in the perceived operation of external factors. Instead, it was suggested that self-efficacy and controllability may both reflect beliefs about the presence of internal as well as external factors. Rather than making a priori assumptions about the internal or external locus of self-efficacy and controllability, this issue is best treated as an empirical question. Also of theoretical significance, the present article tried to dispel the notion that self-efficacy and controllability are incompatible with, or independent of, each other. Although factor analyses of perceived behavioral control items provide clear and consistent evidence for the distinction, there is sufficient commonality between self-efficacy and controllability to suggest a two-level hierarchical model. In this model, perceived behavioral control is the overarching, superordinate construct that is comprised of two lower-level components: self-efficacy and controllability. This view of the control component in the theory of planned behavior implies that measures of perceived behavioral control should contain items that assess self-efficacy as well as controllability. Depending on the purpose of the investigation, a decision can be made to aggregate over all items, treating perceived behavioral control as a unitary factor, or to distinguish between self-efficacy and controllability by entering separate indices into the prediction equation.},

Yet, previous research has shown that some people believe they have personally experienced global warming. Through four related studies, our paper sheds light on what signals of global warming some people believe they are detecting, why, and whether or not it matters. These studies were conducted using population survey and climatic data from a single county in Michigan. Study 1 found that 27\% of the county's adult residents felt that they had personally experienced global warming. Study 2 -- based on content analysis of people's open-ended responses -- found that the most frequently described personal experiences of global warming were changes in seasons (36\%), weather (25\%), lake levels (24\%), animals and plants (20\%), and snowfall (19\%). Study 3 -- based on NOAA climatic data -- found that most, but not all, of these detected signals are borne out in the climatic record. Study 4 -- using the survey data -- found that personal experience of global warming matters in that it predicts perceptions of local risk of global warming, controlling for demographics, political affiliation, and cultural beliefs about national policy outcomes. We conclude that perceived personal experience of global warming appears to heighten people's perception of the risks, likely through some combination of direct experience, vicarious experience (e.g., news media stories), and social construction.},

Because of their potentially recurring nature, floods offer an opportunity for communities to learn from and adapt to these experiences with the goal of increasing resiliency through reflection, modification of former policies, and adoption of new policies. A key component of a community's ability to learn from disaster is how community members perceive the causes of extreme flood events and whether there is risk of future similar events. Perceptions of causes of flooding, including climate change, may be influenced by experiencing a flood event, along with individual preferences for various policies put in place to help a community recover. Using data collected from two rounds of public surveys (n = 903) across six Colorado communities flooded in 2013, we investigate whether there is variation across causal understanding of flooding, and whether this variation can be linked to differences in proximity of damages experienced (personal property, neighborhood, or community). By analyzing these variables, along with other variables (time since flood, political affiliation, and worldview), this study improves our understanding of the factors that drive our beliefs about potential causes of floods, focusing on climate change. The findings suggest that the extent of damage experienced at the neighborhood and community levels can have a significant effect on the perceptions of climate change held by the public. In turn, these beliefs about climate change are positively associated with perceptions of risks of future flooding.},

In a treatment arm receiving reports each quarter, the e¤ects decay over the months between letters and increase again upon receipt of the next letter.

I show that ``pro{\dots}ling,'' or using a statistical decision rule to target the program at households whose observable characteristics predict larger treatment e¤ects, could substantially improve cost e¤ectiveness in future programs. The results provide additional evidence that non-price ``nudges'' can substantially a¤ect consumer behavior.},

Using data from randomized natural field experiments at 600,000 treatment and control households across the United States, I estimate that the average program reduces energy consumption by 2.0\%. The program provides additional evidence that non-price interventions can substantially and cost effectively change consumer behavior: the effect is equivalent to that of a short-run electricity price increase of 11 to 20\%, and the cost effectiveness compares favorably to that of traditional energy conservation programs. Perhaps because the treatment included descriptive social norms, effects are heterogeneous: households in the highest decile of pre-treatment consumption decrease usage by 6.3\%, while consumption by the lowest decile decreases by only 0.3\%. A regression discontinuity design shows that different categories of ``injunctive norms'' played an insignificant role in encouraging relatively low users not to increase usage.},

  abstract = {Background Devastating health effects from recent heat waves, and projected increases in frequency, duration, and severity of heat waves from climate change, highlight the importance of understanding health consequences of heat waves. Objectives We analyzed mortality risk for heat waves in 43 U.S. cities (1987--2005) and investigated how effects relate to heat waves' intensity, duration, or timing in season. Methods Heat waves were defined as {$\geq$} 2 days with temperature {$\geq$} 95th percentile for the community for 1 May through 30 September. Heat waves were characterized by their intensity, duration, and timing in season. Within each community, we estimated mortality risk during each heat wave compared with non-heat wave days, controlling for potential confounders. We combined individual heat wave effect estimates using Bayesian hierarchical modeling to generate overall effects at the community, regional, and national levels. We estimated how heat wave mortality effects were modified by heat wave characteristics (intensity, duration, timing in season). Results Nationally, mortality increased 3.74\% [95\% posterior interval (PI), 2.29--5.22\%] during heat waves compared with non-heat wave days. Heat wave mortality risk increased 2.49\% for every 1{$^\circ$}F increase in heat wave intensity and 0.38\% for every 1-day increase in heat wave duration. Mortality increased 5.04\% (95\% PI, 3.06--7.06\%) during the first heat wave of the summer versus 2.65\% (95\% PI, 1.14--4.18\%) during later heat waves, compared with non-heat wave days. Heat wave mortality impacts and effect modification by heat wave characteristics were more pronounced in the Northeast and Midwest compared with the South. Conclusions We found higher mortality risk from heat waves that were more intense or longer, or those occurring earlier in summer. These findings have implications for decision makers and researchers estimating health effects from climate change.},

  abstract = {The p value is still misinterpreted as the probability that the null hypothesis is true. Even psychologists who correctly understand that p values do not provide this probability may not realize the degree to which p values differ from the probability that the null hypothesis is true. Importantly, previous research on this topic has not addressed the influence of multiple testing, often a reality in psychological studies, and has not extensively considered the influence of different prior probabilities favoring the null and alternative hypotheses. Simulation studies are presented that emphasize the magnitude by which p values are distinct from the posterior probability that the null hypothesis is true, under an extensive set of conditions including multiple testing. Particular emphasis is placed on p values just under .05, given the prevalence of these p values in the published literature, though p values in other intervals are also assessed. In diverse conditions, results indicate that posterior probabilities favoring the null hypothesis are often far removed from .05, and this pattern quickly gets much worse when multiple testing is conducted. Rather than simply telling researchers that p values do not reflect the probability favoring the null hypothesis, as has been done previously, the results presented here allow psychologists to see the evidence provided by various p values. These results have particularly topical implications for the replication crisis, for how much weight should be placed on a single study, and for how the term statistical significance should be interpreted, particularly in conditions typical in psychological research.

Three convenience samples of German adults (N = 881) completed such a measure, the General Ecological Behavior (GEB) scale. Their household electricity consumption was self-reported (Study 1), assessed by a smart-meter (Study 2), or reported by the power company (Study 3). The latter two studies controlled for income, which can boost consumption just as it opens possibilities for behaving ecologically. Within and across studies, analyses revealed a negative association between self-reported ecological behavior and electricity consumption (-.18 {$\leq$} rs {$\leq$} -.22), even with adjustment for income. Furthermore, customers in a green electricity program reported more ecological engagement and consumed one third less electricity than did regular customers. These results indicate the criterion validity of the GEB scale for a highly practically relevant criterion and encourage the use of generic behavior measures in efforts to understand and foster more ecological lifestyles.},

In the present study, we coded 215 papers using Rasch measurement published in 21 applied linguistics journals for multiple features. We found that seven Rasch models and 23 software packages were adopted in these papers, with many-facet Rasch measurement (n\,=\,100) and Facets (n\,=\,113) being the most frequently used Rasch model and software, respectively. Significant differences were detected between the number of papers that applied Rasch measurement to different language skills and components, with writing (n\,=\,63) and grammar (n\,=\,12) being the most and least frequently investigated, respectively. In addition, significant differences were found between the number of papers reporting person separation (n\,=\,73, not reported: n\,=\,142) and item separation (n\,=\,59, not reported: n\,=\,156) and those that did not. An alarming finding was how few papers reported unidimensionality check (n\,=\,57 vs 158) and local independence (n\,=\,19 vs 196). Finally, a multilayer network analysis revealed that research involving Rasch measurement has created two major discrete communities of practice (clusters), which can be characterized by features such as language skills, the Rasch models used, and the reporting of item reliability/separation vs person reliability/separation. Cluster 1 was accordingly labelled the production and performance cluster, whereas cluster 2 was labelled the perception and language elements cluster. Guidelines and recommendations for analyzing unidimensionality, local independence, data-to-model fit, and reliability in Rasch model analysis are proposed.},

  abstract = {Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is a frequently used multivariate analysis technique in statistics. Jennrich and Sampson (1966) solved a significant EFA factor loading matrix rotation problem by deriving the direct Quartimin rotation. Jennrich was also the first to develop standard errors for rotated solutions, although these have still not made their way into most statistical software programs. This is perhaps because Jennrich's achievements were partly overshadowed by the subsequent development of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) by J{\"o}reskog (1969). The strict requirement of zero cross-loadings in CFA, however, often does not fit the data well and has led to a tendency to rely on extensive model modification to find a well-fitting model. In such cases, searching for a well-fitting measurement model may be better carried out by EFA (Browne, 2001). Furthermore, misspecification of zero loadings usually leads to distorted factors with over-estimated factor correlations and subsequent distorted structural relations. This article describes an EFA-SEM (ESEM) approach, where in addition to or instead of a CFA measurement model, an EFA measurement model with rotations can be used in a structural equation model. The ESEM approach has recently been implemented in the Mplus program. ESEM gives access to all the usual SEM parameters and the loading rotation gives a transformation of structural coefficients as well. Standard errors and overall tests of model fit are obtained. Geomin and Target rotations are discussed. Examples of ESEM models include multiple-group EFA with measurement and structural invariance testing, test--retest (longitudinal) EFA, EFA with covariates and direct effects, and EFA with correlated residuals. Testing strategies with sequences of EFA and CFA models are discussed. Simulated and real data are used to illustrate the points.},

  abstract = {Harnessing the fire data revolution, i.e., the abundance of information from satellites, government records, social media, and human health sources, now requires complex and challenging data integration approaches. Defining fire events is key to that effort. In order to understand the spatial and temporal characteristics of fire, or the classic fire regime concept, we need to critically define fire events from remote sensing data. Events, fundamentally a geographic concept with delineated spatial and temporal boundaries around a specific phenomenon that is homogenous in some property, are key to understanding fire regimes and more importantly how they are changing. Here, we describe Fire Events Delineation (FIRED), an event-delineation algorithm, that has been used to derive fire events (N = 51,871) from the MODIS MCD64 burned area product for the coterminous US (CONUS) from January 2001 to May 2019. The optimized spatial and temporal parameters to cluster burned area pixels into events were an 11-day window and a 5-pixel (2315 m) distance, when optimized against 13,741 wildfire perimeters in the CONUS from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity record. The linear relationship between the size of individual FIRED and Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) events for the CONUS was strong (R2 = 0.92 for all events). Importantly, this algorithm is open-source and flexible, allowing the end user to modify the spatio-temporal threshold or even the underlying algorithm approach as they see fit. We expect the optimized criteria to vary across regions, based on regional distributions of fire event size and rate of spread. We describe the derived metrics provided in a new national database and how they can be used to better understand US fire regimes. The open, flexible FIRED algorithm could be utilized to derive events in any satellite product. We hope that this open science effort will help catalyze a community-driven, data-integration effort (termed OneFire) to build a more complete picture of fire.},

As expected, larger sample sizes and better specified models resulted in better cross-validation results. The presence of larger factor loadings increased the number of times the cross-validation indices yielded optimal values for the correctly specified model.},

Resulting disasters have the potential to wreak havoc on the economy, infrastructure, family unit, and human health. Global estimates project that children will be disproportionately impacted by the changing climate -- shouldering 88\% of the related burdens. Exposure to EWEs in childhood is traumatic, with ramifications for mental health specifically. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety have all been associated with childhood EWE exposure and have the potential to persist under certain circumstances. Conversely, many childhood survivors of EWE also demonstrate resilience and experience only transient symptoms. While the majority of studies are focused on the effects resulting from one specific type of disaster (hurricanes), we have synthesized the literature across the various types of EWEs. We describe psychological symptoms and behavior, the potential for long-term effects, and potential protective factors and risk factors. What this paper adds Climate change-related phenomena such as extreme weather events (EWEs) have the potential to impact mood and behavior in children. Posttraumatic stress (PTS) is the most common mental health consequence in child survivors of EWEs. PTS is often comorbid with depression and/or anxiety in this group.},

  abstract = {For journal editors, reviewers, and readers of research articles, structural equation model (SEM) fit has recently become a confusing and contentious area of evaluative methodology. Proponents of two kinds of approaches to model fit can be identified: those who adhere strictly to the result from a null hypothesis significance test, and those who ignore this and instead index model fit as an approximation function. Both have principled reasons for their respective course of action. This paper argues that the chi-square exactfit test is the only substantive test of fit for SEM, but, its sensitivity to discrepancies from expected values at increasing sample sizes can be highly problematic if those discrepancies are considered trivial from an explanatory-theory perspective. On the other hand, suitably scaled indices of approximate fit do not possess this sensitivity to sample size, but neither are they ``tests'' of model fit. The proposed solution to this dilemma is to consider the substantive ````consequences''' of accepting one explanatory model over another in terms of the predictive accuracy of theory-relevant-criteria. If there are none to be evaluated, then it is proposed that no scientifically worthwhile distinction between ```competing'' models can thus be made, which of course begs the question as to why such a SEM application was undertaken in the first place. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In two studies, the authors examined whether individuals are more motivated to pursue long-term collective future goals when they subjectively experience them as temporally proximal, holding constant objective date projections. The authors found that experimentally inducing participants to view distant future climate change consequences as temporally proximal enhanced proenvironmental motivation (Study 1) and behavior during the week following the study (Study 2) because the subjective temporal proximity made them construe climate change goals more concretely (Study 2). Thus, although the temporally distant nature of remote future goals may generally undermine motivation, making these goals feel temporally close can motivate individuals to pursue them in the present.}

In particular, the IRT models included are the three-parameter logistic model, the two-parameter logistic model, the one-parameter logistic model and the Rasch model. Forms can be equated when they present common items (direct equating) or when they can be linked through a chain of forms that present common items in pairs (indirect or chain equating). When two forms can be equated through different paths, a single conversion can be obtained by averaging the equating coefficients. The package calculates direct and chain equating coefficients. The averaging of direct and chain coefficients that link the same two forms is performed through the bisector method. Furthermore, the package provides analytic standard errors of direct, chain and average equating coefficients.},

Here, we link the C-ROADS climate model to a social model of behavioural change to examine how interactions between perceived risk and emissions behaviour influence projected climate change. Our coupled climate and social model resulted in a global temperature change ranging from 3.4--6.2\,{$^\circ$}C by 2100 compared with 4.9\,{$^\circ$}C for the C-ROADS model alone, and led to behavioural uncertainty that was of a similar magnitude to physical uncertainty (2.8\,{$^\circ$}C versus 3.5\,{$^\circ$}C). Model components with the largest influence on temperature were the functional form of response to extreme events, interaction of perceived behavioural control with perceived social norms, and behaviours leading to sustained emissions reductions. Our results suggest that policies emphasizing the appropriate attribution of extreme events to climate change and infrastructural mitigation may reduce climate change the most.},

The impacts of climate change alter perceptions of risk and emissions behavior that, in turn, influence the rate and magnitude of climate change. Addressing this deficiency in climate models requires a substantial interdisciplinary effort to couple models of climate and human behavior. We suggest a multi-model approach that considers a range of theories and implementations of human behavior and social systems, similar to the multi-model approach that has been used to explore the physical climate system. We describe the importance of linking social factors with climate processes and identify four priorities essential to advancing the development of coupled social-climate models.},

Behavioral flexibility allows animals to rapidly cope with changing environmental conditions, and behavior represents an important component of a species' adaptive capacity in the face of climate change. However, there is currently a lack of knowledge about the limits or constraints on behavioral responses to changing conditions. Here, we characterize the contexts in which organisms respond to climate variability through behavior. First, we quantify patterns in behavioral responses across taxa with respect to timescales, climatic stimuli, life-history traits, and ecology. Next, we identify existing knowledge gaps, research biases, and other challenges. Finally, we discuss how conservation practitioners and resource managers can incorporate an improved understanding of behavioral flexibility into natural resource management and policy decisions.},

We also discuss the within-between RE model, sometimes misleadingly labelled a `hybrid' model, showing that it is the most general of the three, with all the strengths of the other two. As such, and because it allows for important extensions---notably random slopes---we argue it should be used (as a starting point at least) in all multilevel analyses. We develop the argument through simulations, evaluating how these models cope with some likely mis-specifications. These simulations reveal that (1) failing to include random slopes can generate anti-conservative standard errors, and (2) assuming random intercepts are Normally distributed, when they are not, introduces only modest biases. These results strengthen the case for the use of, and need for, these models.},

These new estimates of state-level climate concern enable us to exploit geographic variation in locally experienced climate changes over an extended time period. We show that climate concern peaked in 2000 and again in 2017 and that climate concern is modestly responsive to changes in state-level temperatures. Overall, our results suggest that continued increases in temperature are likely to cause public concern about climate change to grow in the future. But a warming climate, on its own, is unlikely to yield a consensus in the mass public about the threat posed by climate change.},

Climate change seems to be at odds with the immediate, present threats to which humans are adapted to cope (Gifford et al., 2009; Schultz, 2014; van Vugt et al., 2014). In contrast to immediate dangers, climate change is typically abstract, large scale, slow and often unrelated to the welfare of our daily lives (e.g., Ornstein and Ehrlich, 1989; Gifford, 2011). But there are moments when the consequences of climate change are readily apparent, such as extreme weather events. In the current paper, we examine the impact of personal experience with an extreme weather event, and the impact of this experience on beliefs about climate change, and intentions to take actions that can help prepare for and mitigate the consequences of climate change.},

  abstract = {The random forest algorithm, proposed by L. Breiman in 2001, has been extremely successful as a general-purpose classification and regression method. The approach, which combines several randomized decision trees and aggregates their predictions by averaging, has shown excellent performance in settings where the number of variables is much larger than the number of observations. Moreover, it is versatile enough to be applied to large-scale problems, is easily adapted to various ad hoc learning tasks, and returns measures of variable importance. The present article reviews the most recent theoretical and methodological developments for random forests. Emphasis is placed on the mathematical forces driving the algorithm, with special attention given to the selection of parameters, the resampling mechanism, and variable importance measures. This review is intended to provide non-experts easy access to the main ideas.},

This sectoral categorization, however, is limited in its capacity to reveal the total impacts of consumer activities on energy use and its related environmental impacts. In this paper, we propose an alternative paradigm, called the Consumer Lifestyle Approach (CLA), to explore the relationship between consumer activities and environmental impacts in the US. Estimates based on our methodology reveal that more than 80\% of the energy used and the CO2 emitted in the US are a consequence of consumer demands and the economic activities to support these demands. Direct influences due to consumer activities (home energy use and personal travel) are 4\% of the US GDP, but account for 28\% and 41\% of US energy use and CO2 emissions, respectively. Indirect influences (such as housing operations, transportation operations, food, and apparel) involve more than twice the direct energy use and CO2 emissions. Characterization of both direct and indirect energy use and emissions is critical to the design of more effective energy and CO2 emission policies. It may also help erode the false dichotomy of ``them versus us'' (industrial polluters versus consumers) references to the locus of responsibility for control of energy use and CO2 emissions.},

This book, the first comprehensive analysis of these dramatic events, explains how and why some public disasters change political agendas and, ultimately, public policies. Thomas A. Birkland explores important successes and failures in the policy process by analyzing the political outcomes of four types of events: earthquakes, hurricanes, oil spills, and nuclear accidents. Using this empirical data to go beyond an intuitive understanding of focusing events, he presents a theory of where and when these events will gain attention and how they trigger political reactions. Birkland concludes that different types of disasters result in different kinds of agenda politics. Public outrage over the highly visible damage caused by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, for example, ended a fourteen-year logjam holding back Congressional legislation to regulate oil spill cleanups. On the other hand, the intangible effects of Three Mile Island had less concrete results in a political arena that was already highly polarized. Integrating a variety of theories on the policy process, including agenda setting, policy communities, advocacy coalitions, the political aspects of the news media, and the use of symbols in political debate, Birkland illuminates the dynamics of event-driven policy activity. As the first extensive study of its kind, this book offers new insights into the policy process.},

Using natural disasters and industrial accidents as examples, most focusing events change the dominant issues on the agenda in a policy domain, they can lead to interest group mobilization, and groups often actively seek to expand or contain issues after a focusing event. I explain how differences in the composition of policy communities and the nature of the events themselves influence group and agenda dynamics. The organization of policy communities is an important factor in agenda setting, but agenda setting and group politics vary considerably with the type of event and the nature of the policy community.},

  abstract = {Even before the wreckage of a disaster is cleared, one question is foremost in the minds of the public: "What can be done to prevent this from happening again?" Today, news media and policymakers often invoke the "lessons of September 11" and the "lessons of Hurricane Katrina." Certainly, these unexpected events heightened awareness about problems that might have contributed to or worsened the disasters, particularly about gaps in preparation. Inquiries and investigations are made that claim that "lessons" were "learned" from a disaster, leading us to assume that we will be more ready the next time a similar threat looms, and that our government will put in place measures to protect us. In Lessons of Disaster, Thomas Birkland takes a critical look at this assumption. We know that disasters play a role in setting policy agendas---in getting policymakers to think about problems---but does our government always take the next step and enact new legislation or regulations? To determine when and how a catastrophic event serves as a catalyst for true policy change, the author examines four categories of disasters: aviation security, homeland security, earthquakes, and hurricanes. He explores lessons learned from each, focusing on three types of policy change: change in the larger social construction of the issues surrounding the disaster; instrumental change, in which laws and regulations are made; and political change, in which alliances are created and shifted. Birkland argues that the type of disaster affects the types of lessons learned from it, and that certain conditions are necessary to translate awareness into new policy, including media attention, salience for a large portion of the public, the existence of advocacy groups for the issue, and the preexistence of policy ideas that can be drawn upon. This timely study concludes with a discussion of the interplay of multiple disasters, focusing on the initial government response to Hurricane Katrina and the negative effect the September 11 catastrophe seems to have had on reaction to that tragedy.},

We begin with a review of the streams metaphor and agenda-setting theory, as well as broader theories of the policy process, as these bodies of scholarship relate to focusing events. We then consider the strengths and weaknesses of Kingdon and Birkland's approaches  to focusing events. We argue that it is important to consider how ``focusing events'' influence policy by looking at the level of the policy domain, rather than at individual events. Scholars have typically applied the focusing event concept to individual case studies, rather than understanding long-term agenda and policy dynamics in domains prone to focusing events. Furthermore, analyzing trends in a domain over several decades provides greater understanding about how and when policy change occurs and it demonstrates the policy learning is an iterative and accumulative process. Finally, we conclude with comments on methodological considerations for future research in a project we intend to undertake.},

In particular, it focuses on policies that address the 'value--action gap' in environmental policy. Using evidence from the author's research connected with the UK Going for Green Sustainable Communities Project in Huntingdonshire, the paper highlights the tensions between national policies that are based on an 'information deficit' model of participation, and local research and experience that posits a more complex relationship between individuals and institutions. While this suggests the need to develop more differentiated policies based on the restructuring of socioeconomic and political institutions, the paper warns against knee-jerk calls for more local, community or public participation which simply replace one set of generalised appeals with another. The paper concludes that greater emphasis must be placed on the negotiation of partnerships that are more sensitive to local diversity, and which involve a more equitable distribution of responsibility between different environmental stakeholders.},

We extend the basic approach to data where there is a relationship between difference and magnitude, both with a simple logarithmic transformation approach and a new, more general, regression approach. We discuss the importance of the repeatability of each method separately and compare an estimate of this to the limits of agreement. We extend the limits of agreement approach to data with repeated measurements, proposing new estimates for equal numbers of replicates by each method on each subject, for unequal numbers of replicates, and for replicated data collected in pairs, where the underlying value of the quantity being measured is changing. Finally, we describe a nonparametric approach to comparing methods.},

Climate change has been claimed to have low salience as a risk issue because it cannot be directly experienced. Still, personal factors such as strength of belief in local effects of climate change have been shown to correlate strongly with responses to climate change and there is a growing literature on the hypothesis that personal experience of climate change (and/or its effects) explains responses to climate change. Here we provide, using survey data from 845 private forest owners operating in a wide range of bio-climatic as well as economic-social-political structures in a latitudinal gradient across Europe, the first evidence that the personal strength of belief and perception of local effects of climate change, highly significantly explain human responses to climate change. A logistic regression model was fitted to the two variables, estimating expected probabilities ranging from 0.07 (SD {\textpm}0.01) to 0.81 (SD {\textpm}0.03) for self-reported adaptive measures taken. Adding socio-demographic variables improved the fit, estimating expected probabilities ranging from 0.022 (SD {\textpm}0.008) to 0.91 (SD {\textpm}0.02). We conclude that to explain and predict adaptation to climate change, the combination of personal experience and belief must be considered.},

A toolbox for analysing individuals' decision-making and valuations in the landscape is described. The toolbox can provide evidence on the drivers of individuals' decision-making in the landscape and the decision strategies they apply. This evidence can be used to identify communication needs and to design guidelines for effective communication. The tool for value elicitation separates the instrumental values (means) and end values (goals) of individuals with respect to locations in the landscape. This distinction, and knowledge of the end values in the landscape, are critical for the achievement of policy goals and for spatial planning from a democratic point of view. The individuals-oriented landscape approach has roots in geography and draws on behavioural decision research together with a model for integrating ``science and proven experience'' that is widely used in public decision-making in the Nordic countries. The approach differs from other scholarly disciplines addressing sustainable land-use planning. It is suitable for application on decision-making problems that include trade-offs between values. An overview of empirical studies is provided in which the individuals-oriented landscape rationale is applied to climate change.},

I also compare the different types of specific indirect effects. These are the influences that are transmitted through particular variables in a model.

  abstract = {Causality was at the center of the early history of structural equation models (SEMs) which continue to serve as the most popular approach to causal analysis in the social sciences. Through decades of development, critics and defenses of the capability of SEMs to support causal inference have accumulated. A variety of misunderstandings and myths about the nature of SEMs and their role in causal analysis have emerged, and their repetition has led some to believe they are true. Our chapter is organized by presenting eight myths about causality and SEMs in the hope that this will lead to a more accurate understanding. More specifically, the eight myths are the following: (1) SEMs aim to establish causal relations from associations alone, (2) SEMs and regression are essentially equivalent, (3) no causation without manipulation, (4) SEMs are not equipped to handle nonlinear causal relationships, (5) a potential outcome framework is more principled than SEMs, (6) SEMs are not applicable to experiments with randomized treatments, (7) mediation analysis in SEMs is inherently noncausal, and (8) SEMs do not test any major part of the theory against the data. We present the facts that dispel these myths, describe what SEMs can and cannot do, and briefly present our critique of current practice using SEMs. We conclude that the current capabilities of SEMs to formalize and implement causal inference tasks are indispensible; its potential to do more is even greater.},

A theoretical claim is made to frame traditional social psychological research on environmental concern into a "place specific" perspective. Two studies are presented in which pro-environmental attitudes, regional identity (RI) and PA are analyzed in 2 different Italian national parks. In Study 1, 115 local residents (people who live inside the park area) and non-local residents (people who live in the same region but outside the park area) were interviewed by questionnaire. Results showed local groups with negative attitudes toward both general and specific natural protected areas and high degrees of RI and PA and non-local groups with the opposite pattern. In Study 2, (854 Ss) the same differences between locals and non-locals were confirmed in a larger sample; also, various subgroups of local residents who differ in terms of their prevalent economic activities and specific interests were compared. Ss more involved in local economic activities showed more negative attitudes toward natural protected areas (generally and specifically) and higher degrees of Rl and place attachment than Ss more involved in ecological and pro-environmental activities.

  abstract = {A growing body of research demonstrates that believing action to reduce the risks of climate change is both possible (self-efficacy) and effective (response efficacy) is essential to motivate and sustain risk mitigation efforts. Despite this potentially critical role of efficacy beliefs, measures and their use vary wildly in climate change risk perception and communication research, making it hard to compare and learn from efficacy studies. To address this problem and advance our understanding of efficacy beliefs, this article makes three contributions. First, we present a theoretically motivated approach to measuring climate change mitigation efficacy, in light of diverse proposed, perceived, and previously researched strategies. Second, we test this in two national survey samples (Amazon's Mechanical Turk N = 405, GfK Knowledge Panel N = 1,820), demonstrating largely coherent beliefs by level of action and discrimination between types of efficacy. Four additive efficacy scales emerge: personal self-efficacy, personal response efficacy, government and collective self-efficacy, and government and collective response efficacy. Third, we employ the resulting efficacy scales in mediation models to test how well efficacy beliefs predict climate change policy support, controlling for specific knowledge, risk perceptions, and ideology, and allowing for mediation by concern. Concern fully mediates the relatively strong effects of perceived risk on policy support, but only partly mediates efficacy beliefs. Stronger government and collective response efficacy beliefs and personal self-efficacy beliefs are both directly and indirectly associated with greater support for reducing the risks of climate change, even after controlling for ideology and causal beliefs about climate change.},

Although collective action related to climate change was rare post-event, we observed community discussion about the event's link to climate change in slightly more than half of the cases, especially in Democratic and/or highly educated communities that experienced events for which attribution to climate change is more certain. Our results suggest that, although a single event may have limited impact on discussion or collective action about climate change, partisanship and an event's attribution to climate change matter.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Four human values are considered to underlie individuals' environmental beliefs and behaviors: biospheric (i.e., concern for environment), altruistic (i.e., concern for others), egoistic (i.e., concern for personal resources) and hedonic values (i.e., concern for pleasure and comfort). These values are typically measured with an adapted and shortened version of the Schwartz Value Survey (SVS), to which we refer as the Environmental-SVS (E-SVS). Despite being well-validated, recent research has indicated some concerns about the SVS methodology (e.g., comprehensibility, self-presentation biases) and suggested an alternative method of measuring human values: The Portrait Value Questionnaire (PVQ). However, the PVQ has not yet been adapted and applied to measure values most relevant to understand environmental beliefs and behaviors. Therefore, we tested the Environmental-PVQ (E-PVQ) -- a PVQ variant of E-SVS --and compared it with the E-SVS in two studies. Our findings provide strong support for the validity and reliability of both the E-SVS and E-PVQ. In addition, we find that respondents slightly preferred the E-PVQ over the E-SVS (Study 1). In general, both scales correlate similarly to environmental self-identity (Study 1), energy behaviors (Studies 1 and 2), pro-environmental personal norms, climate change beliefs and policy support (Study 2). Accordingly, both methodologies show highly similar results and seem well-suited for measuring human values underlying environmental behaviors and beliefs.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Covariance structure modeling, also known as structural equation modeling or causal modeling, appears increasingly popular. Such techniques can be used to conduct tests of complex theory on empirical data. To conduct such tests, researchers need measures of known factor structure and the knowledge of structural relations among the constructs of interest. Researchers typically have neither the required measures nor the knowledge of structural relations. Instead of conducting tests of theory, researchers use covariance structure models to develop measurements and theoretical models. This paper discusses why such use of covariance structure models is unlikely to produce scientific progress and proposes some alternative procedures thought to be more fruitful.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

When an environmentalist considers a pro-environmental behavior such as carrying reusable grocery bags, being observed by others may motivate signaling the valued group membership and may increase behavior (``green to be seen''). When an anti-environmentalist considers a pro-environmental behavior that signals an unwanted social identity, being observed may lead to less behavior (``brown to keep down''). United States residents completed three correlational surveys (total N~=~1126) of identity, visibility, and self-reported behavior frequency using the Recurring Pro-environmental Behavior Scale. Three multilevel studies revealed that environmentalist identity predicted pro-environmental behavior more strongly for high-visibility behaviors, controlling for confounds at the person level (attitudes, political identity) and the behavior level (difficulty, effectiveness). This research helps uncover the key social identities and contextual factors that lead individuals to embrace or reject pro-environmental behaviors.},

Shifting social identities may be an under-appreciated explanation of this gap: identification with environmentalists in the U.S. dropped from 78\% to 42\% since 1991. In four pre-registered studies of U.S. residents (total N\,=\,2,033), we explored the predictors and outcomes of environmentalist identity. We also developed a novel implicit measure of less deliberate aspects of environmentalist identity. We used explicit and implicit environmentalist identity to predict self-reported environmental behaviors and policy preferences. Meta-analysis of our pre-registered studies revealed that explicit identity was moderately associated with implicit identity (r\,=\,0.24). Explicit identity strongly and uniquely predicted pro-environmental behaviors and policy preferences (partial rs\,=\,.58, .62), while implicit identity did not uniquely predict either (partial rs\,=\,.05, .05). Our findings highlight the importance of social identity in conservation.},

However, there is no dominant framework for categorizing behaviors (e.g., diet/travel; public/private; consumer/advocate) nor an umbrella theory for explaining how such behaviors arise. It remains unclear how researchers select which types of pro-environmental behavior to study. There is also debate about whether prioritizing easy-to-measure pro-environmental behaviors may limit the conservation impact of research. Learning how researchers select theories and behaviors to study, and what challenges they perceive in doing so, could help advance these debates. We report a survey of 225 pro-environmental behavior researchers about how they select theories, methods, and behaviors, and their open science practices, using closed questions and open responses with thematic coding. The results show gaps between what researchers recommend and what they practice (e.g., there are too few replications), and we identify the most used theories and what they are used for. The findings also provide insights on the most common types of pro-environmental behaviors and measures. Overall, these results show how researchers currently balance priorities, including the ease of measurement and the perceived importance of impact. We hope these results stimulate discussion and support high-quality research on pro-environmental behaviors.},

This study extends previous conceptual models explaining risk perception associated with global climate change by adding a spatial dimension. Specifically, Geographic Information Systems and spatial analytical techniques are used to map and measure survey respondents' physical risk associated with expected climate change. Using existing spatial data, multiple measures of climate change vulnerability are analyzed along with demographic, attitudinal, and social contextual variables derived from a representative national survey to predict variation in risk perception. Bivariate correlation and multivariate regression analyses are used to identify and explain the most important indicators shaping individual risk perception. Analysis of the data suggests that the relationship between actual and perceived risk is driven by specific types of physical conditions and experiences. {\copyright} Sage Publications, Inc. 2008.},

We find evidence that states where climate change is perceived to be a problem, and where attention to environmental issues is high, are more likely to adopt relevant policies. Furthermore, states with Republican majorities in either legislative chamber are less likely to adopt climate policies.

  abstract = {Unlike the scientific definition of global warming (GW), public discussion often links the existence of GW to daily temperatures rather than long-term averages. Previous research found that daily weather is perceived as personal experiences with GW. Additionally, prior beliefs about GW can affect interpretations of such experiences as evidence for the existence of GW. However, previous studies demonstrating that beliefs affect interpretations of experiences were based on correlational designs---limiting causal inferences---and relied only on self-reports of remembered personal experiences instead of direct interpretations of weather. The authors present the first randomized experiment investigating how people interpret daily temperatures in terms of the evidence that it provides about GW, clarifying the psychological causes for different interpretations of the same experiences across individuals. They test the influence of knowledge about (and beliefs in) GW on the interpretation of daily temperatures across two framing conditions labeled weather (interpreting a temperature as abnormal weather) and climate (interpreting a temperature as evidence of GW). The authors use signal detection theory to measure the decision-maker's (a) ability to discriminate between temperatures, called sensitivity, and (b) threshold for describing a temperature as abnormal, called the decision threshold. The results replicate previous research finding a motivational distortion in interpreting temperatures as evidence of GW and further find belief-consistent distortions in decision thresholds while observing no measurable change in sensitivity. In other words, people know when temperatures are abnormally hot, but classify ambiguous events (i.e., less extreme abnormalities) differently based on their beliefs in GW.},

The one-, two-, and three-parameter logistic (1PL, 2PL, and 3PL) models are nested, and as such can be compared using likelihood ratio (LR) tests. The null hypothesis in the LR test for selection among the 2PL and 3PL models sets the guessing parameters to their lower bound of 0. This violates one of the assumptions of the LR test and renders the usual {$\chi$}2 reference distribution inappropriate for the comparison. A review of the current literature revealed that this problem is not well understood in the educational measurement field. Ignoring this issue can lead to selection of an overly simplified model, with implications for the ability estimates. In this article, the use of the LR test for item response model selection is investigated, with the goal of providing practitioners with an appropriate method of selecting the most parsimonious model. The results of simulation studies indicate the nature of the problem, with inaccurate Type I error rates for cases where the inappropriate null distribution was used. An analysis of data from a statewide mathematics test showed differences pertinent to subsequent analyses.},

From the perspective of construal level theory, decreasing psychological distance should not itself influence people's willingness to act but change the processes that underlie individual decision-making. We conducted two experiments in which we manipulated the psychological distance of climate change. We found that participants with a distant focus relied more on scepticism to represent risks and make decisions about supporting climate change, whereas participants with a proximal perspective relied more on fear when making such judgements. However, the predicted Fear~{\texttimes}~Distance interaction was only found when self-reported fear rather than experimentally manipulated fear was used as a moderator. Our results suggest that simply proximising won't increase engagement and call for a more differentiated perspective on the effects of psychological distance in the context of climate change.},

This perception has sparked interest in construal level theory (CLT) as a framework to understand how the public sees climate change, and how the subjective psychological distance at which people mentally represent objects affects their decisions and actions. Although at first CLT may appear to be the ideal lens through which to investigate psychological distance, I argue that applications of the theory in explaining and predicting climate change (in)action are limited. Researchers have sometimes used CLT in ways inconsistent with its original articulation; namely, (1) when claiming that psychological distant events are less personally relevant than close events; (2) when treating psychological distance as a stable individual belief; and (3) when speculating about what happens when such beliefs change. This article identifies places where research diverges from the scope of CLT, and suggests alternative perspectives that are theoretically better suited to investigating some important and common questions. As a constructive plea for theoretically rigorous research projects and practical work, this article outlines directions for future research that should help advance the field's understanding of psychological distance in the context of climate change and make interventions more effective.},

Here we bring together data on the changing risk and societal burden of wildfire in the United States. We estimate that nearly 50 million homes are currently in the wildland--urban interface in the United States, a number increasing by 1 million houses every 3 y. To illustrate how changes in wildfire activity might affect air pollution and related health outcomes, and how these linkages might guide future science and policy, we develop a statistical model that relates satellite-based fire and smoke data to information from pollution monitoring stations. Using the model, we estimate that wildfires have accounted for up to 25\% of PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter {$<$}2.5 {$\mu$}m) in recent years across the United States, and up to half in some Western regions, with spatial patterns in ambient smoke exposure that do not follow traditional socioeconomic pollution exposure gradients. We combine the model with stylized scenarios to show that fuel management interventions could have large health benefits and that future health impacts from climate-change--induced wildfire smoke could approach projected overall increases in temperature-related mortality from climate change---but that both estimates remain uncertain. We use model results to highlight important areas for future research and to draw lessons for policy.},

  abstract = {Managers and researchers agree on the importance of understanding the nature of humans' attachment to place in order to reduce environmental impacts in protected areas. Attachment has been discussed as having implications for pro-environmental behaviors directed at protecting natural resources and informing sustainable recreation and ecosystem management. Accordingly, this study examined whether residents' (who might also be park visitors) attachment to a place (i.e. a national park) mediated the relationship between community attachment and engagement in participatory resource management. Drawing on responses from 239 residents in communities surrounding Retezat National Park in Romania, place attachment, community attachment, and pro-environmental civic engagement behavioral beliefs were hypothesized as independent variables. A high correlation was observed between place attachment factors, place identity and place dependency which suggested a weak differentiation of the two factors. Pro-environmental civic engagement intentions were found to vary depending on residents' beliefs regarding pro-environmental civic engagement and level of place attachment. Both community attachment and park related place attachment played a role in predicting citizens' levels of pro-environmental civic engagement beliefs. Parks that are perceived to have a level of mutual benefit and co-management generate more support toward conservation and recreational use goals. Management implications Local residents represent a key stakeholder group for parks and protected areas because of their constant interaction with the setting through recreation and other activities. This study reveals the importance of understanding the social environment within communities proximal to a park and how social perceptions can shape attachment to a protected area with implications for pro-environmental civic engagement beliefs and intentions to sustain natural resource protection. Programs and initiatives designed to increase local residents' attachment to their community (e.g. through recreation programming, special events like concerts, wildlife oriented walks, nature oriented games) should be encouraged and supported by park managers. Allowing some carefully managed and zonal extractive uses of the park also facilitates more positive social connections and attitudes toward the park, as long as other extensive park area resources are protected and basic principles of sustainability and conservation are followed. Based on responses to the civic engagement beliefs and intention items in this study, it would also be advisable to provide opportunities for local residents to participate in meetings, public hearings, community projects and management decisions, to sustain trust in park managers, which is very important to local impressions of a park and positive park attachment attitudes.},

A general modeling framework is discussed, and the applications of this framework in diverse contexts are presented, including large-scale educational surveys, randomized efficacy studies, and diagnostic measurement. Other topics covered include parameter estimation and model fit evaluation. Both classical (numerical integration based) and more modern (stochastic) parameter estimation approaches are discussed. Similarly, limited information goodness-of-fit testing and posterior predictive model checking are reviewed and contrasted. The review concludes with a discussion of some emerging strands in IRT research such as response time modeling, crossed random effects models, and non-standard models for response processes.},

Two planetary boundaries have been fully transgressed, i.e., are at high risk, biosphere integrity and biogeochemical flows, and agriculture has been the major driver of the transgression. Three are in a zone of uncertainty i.e., at increasing risk, with agriculture the major driver of two of those, landsystem change and freshwater use, and a significant contributor to the third, climate change. Agriculture is also a significant or major contributor to change for many of those planetary boundaries still in the safe zone. To reduce the role of agriculture in transgressing planetary boundaries, many interventions will be needed, including those in broader food systems.},

Hence both qualitative and quantitative information are essential in evaluating the validity of measures. Methods We review classical test theory and item response theory approaches to evaluating PRO measures including frequency of responses to each category of the items in a multi-item scale, the distribution of scale scores, floor and ceiling effects, the relationship between item response options and the total score, and the extent to which hypothesized ``difficulty'' (severity) order of items is represented by observed responses. Conclusion Classical test theory and item response theory can be useful in providing a quantitative assessment of items and scales during the content validity phase of patient-reported outcome measures. Depending on the particular type of measure and the specific circumstances, either one or both approaches should be considered to help maximize the content validity of PRO measures.},

Although a link between perceptions of climate and weather is well-established, such assumptions have not been empirically tested. Here we show, using nationally representative data, that directly following a period of severe cold weather in the UK, three times as many people saw these events as pointing towards the reality of climate change, than as disconfirming it. This we argue was a consequence of these cold winters being incorporated into a conceptualisation of extreme or `unnatural' weather resulting from climate change. We also show that the way in which people interpret cold weather is associated with levels of pre-existing scepticism about climate change, which is in turn related to more general worldviews. Drawing attention to `extreme' weather as a consequence of climate change can be a useful communication device, however this is problematic in the case of seasonal cold.},

In this manuscript, we contribute to the debate by using data from pre- and post-extreme event surveys to examine the effects of the 2012 Midwestern US drought on agricultural advisors' climate change beliefs, adaptation attitudes, and risk perceptions. We found that neither climate change beliefs nor attitudes toward adaptation changed significantly as a result of the drought. Risk perceptions did change, however, with advisors becoming more concerned about risks from drought and pests and less concerned about risks related to flooding and ponding. Though increased risk perceptions were significantly associated with more favorable adaptation attitudes, the effects were not large enough to cause an overall shift to more favorable attitudes toward adaptation. The results suggest that extreme climate events might not cause significant shifts in climate beliefs, at least not immediately. Additionally, the results caution that policy designs that rely on increasing risk perceptions to motivate action on climate change may be overestimating the effects of extreme events on feeling at risk, at least in the context of buffered systems such as large commercial agriculture in the US.},

Five factors should account for changes in levels of concern: extreme weather events, public access to accurate scientific information, media coverage, elite cues, and movement/countermovement advocacy. Structural equation modeling indicates that elite cues, movement advocacy efforts, weather, and structural economic factors influence the level of public concern about climate change. While media coverage exerts an important influence, it is itself largely a function of elite cues and economic factors.

This article seeks to address both applied practitioners and researchers interested in a more formal explanation of some of the results. For practitioners, the framework, illustrative examples and code should equip them with a practical approach to address the issues raised by missing data (particularly using multiple imputation), alongside an overview of how the various approaches in the literature relate. In particular, we describe how multiple imputation can be readily used for sensitivity analyses, which are still infrequently performed. For those interested in more formal derivations, we give outline arguments for key results, use simple examples to show how methods relate, and references for full details. The ideas are illustrated with a cohort study, a multi-centre case control study and a randomised clinical trial.},

To shed some light on this topic, this article undertakes the first investigation of whether the association between environmental attitudes and pro-environmental behavior is heterogeneous or, more concretely, if the existence of this association depends on the intensity of environmental attitudes. Multilevel regressions were implemented with a nationally representative sample of Spanish people aged 18 years old and older. The results reveal a pattern of heterogeneity, such that pro-environmental behavior is only associated with strong environmental attitudes, as arise when people believe that the environment should be protected, even if this goal is expensive. This study also controls for the influence of socio-economic characteristics on pro-environmental behavior, which correlates positively with education and age. Women exhibit more pro-environmental behavior than men. On the basis of these findings, this article offers notable implications for policy makers and researchers.},

Data were collected using an online survey distributed to season ticket holders after the 2019 college football season that featured three sponsored sustainability initiatives at each home game. Multivariate analysis of variance and chi-square difference tests found that self-identified Democrats reported significantly higher pro-environmental values and norms, but sustainability program engagement, sponsored initiatives awareness, and influence of initiatives on behavior were politically neutral. Path analysis found that ascription of responsibility was a significant predictor of sustainability-related engagement and behaviors for both Independents and Republicans.

  abstract = {The oft-repeated claim that Earth's biota is entering a sixth ``mass extinction'' depends on clearly demonstrating that current extinction rates are far above the ``background'' rates prevailing between the five previous mass extinctions. Earlier estimates of extinction rates have been criticized for using assumptions that might overestimate the severity of the extinction crisis. We assess, using extremely conservative assumptions, whether human activities are causing a mass extinction. First, we use a recent estimate of a background rate of 2 mammal extinctions per 10,000 species per 100 years (that is, 2 E/MSY), which is twice as high as widely used previous estimates. We then compare this rate with the current rate of mammal and vertebrate extinctions. The latter is conservatively low because listing a species as extinct requires meeting stringent criteria. Even under our assumptions, which would tend to minimize evidence of an incipient mass extinction, the average rate of vertebrate species loss over the last century is up to 100 times higher than the background rate. Under the 2 E/MSY background rate, the number of species that have gone extinct in the last century would have taken, depending on the vertebrate taxon, between 800 and 10,000 years to disappear. These estimates reveal an exceptionally rapid loss of biodiversity over the last few centuries, indicating that a sixth mass extinction is already under way. Averting a dramatic decay of biodiversity and the subsequent loss of ecosystem services is still possible through intensified conservation efforts, but that window of opportunity is rapidly closing.},

We performed a simulation study to compare FIML for PI and LMS. We recommend using FIML for LMS when the indicators are missing completely at random (MCAR) or missing at random (MAR) and when they are normally distributed. FIML for LMS produces unbiased parameter estimates with small variances, correct Type I error rates, and high statistical power of interaction effects. We illustrated the use of these methods by analyzing the interaction effect between advanced cancer patients' depression and change of inner peace well-being on future hopelessness levels.},

We approach risk perception by attending to two components of overall risk perception: perceived probability of an event occurring and perceived consequences if an event occurs. Using a two-period longitudinal data set collected from a survey of homeowners living in a fire-prone area of Colorado, we find that study participants' initial high levels of perceived probability and consequences of a wildfire did not change substantially after extreme wildfire events in the intervening years. More specifically, perceived probability of a wildfire changed very little, whereas the perceived consequences of a wildfire went up a bit. In addition, models of risk perceptions show that the two components of overall risk perception are correlated with somewhat different factors, and experience is not found to be one of the strongest correlates with perceived risk. These results reflect the importance of distinguishing the components of overall risk and modeling them separately to facilitate additional insights into the complexities of risk perceptions, factors related to perceived risk, and change in risk perceptions over time.},

The size and strength of a TC are defined, respectively, as the azimuthally averaged radius of 17 m s-1 of ocean-surface winds (R17) and the azimuthally averaged tangential wind within 1{$^\circ$}--2.5{$^\circ$}-latitude radius from the TC center (outer-core wind strength, OCS). The mean TC size and strength are found to be 2.13{$^\circ$} latitude and 19.6 m s-1, respectively, in the WNP, and 1.83{$^\circ$} latitude and 18.7 m s-1 in the NA. While the correlation between size and strength is strong (r {$\approx$} 0.9), that between intensity and either size or strength is weak. Seasonally, midsummer (July) and late-season (October) TCs are significantly larger in the WNP, while the mean size is largest in September in the NA. The percentage frequency of TCs having large size or high strength is also found to vary spatially and seasonally. In addition, the interannual variation of TC size and strength in the WNP correlate significantly with the TC lifetimes and the effect of El Ni{\~n}o over the WNP. TC lifetime and seasonal subtropical ridge activities are shown to be potential factors that affect TC size and strength.},

Here, TC size is defined as the azimuthal mean radius of 17 m s-1 surface winds from the TC centre. While the TC size climatology for the Western North Pacific (WNP) and North Atlantic (NA) has been documented in previous studies, those for the Eastern North Pacific (ENP), South Indian Ocean (SI) and South Pacific (SP) have yet to be examined in detail, which is the objective of this study. Among all the basins, TCs over the WNP are the largest and have the largest variance, while those over the ENP are the smallest. In addition, TCs in the Northern Hemisphere (WNP, NA and ENP) have two seasonal size peaks, but those in the Southern Hemisphere (SI and SP) have only one. An important finding is that for all basins, the size of a TC does not necessarily increase with latitude monotonically, but reaches the maximum at some latitudinal region. Such a result agrees well with a recent theoretical study in terms of a balance between the inertial stability associated with the TC circulation and the import of angular momentum into the TC.},

A two-wave survey corresponding to multiple extreme weather events in Texas, including a natural experiment with power outage data from the 2021 North American Winter Storms, shows that personal experiences with extreme weather reduce the partisan divide in climate beliefs and polices. Scientific information attributing extreme weather events to climate change, however, had no effect in closing the partisan gap.

A meaningful comparison can be made between the groups when there is no differential item functioning (DIF) or differential test functioning (DTF). During the past three decades, much progress has been made in detecting DIF and DTF. However, little research has been conducted on what researchers can do after such detection. This study presents and evaluates a confirmatory multigroup multidimensional item response model to obtain the purified item parameter estimates, person scores, and impact estimates on the primary dimension, controlling for the secondary dimension due to DIF. In addition, the item response model approach was compared with current practices of DIF treatment such as deleting and ignoring DIF items and using multigroup item response models through simulation studies. The authors suggested guidelines for DIF treatment based on the simulation study results.},

Principal component analysis on standardized residuals has been used to check dimensionality, especially under the family of Rasch models. It has been suggested that an eigenvalue greater than 1.5 for the first eigenvalue signifies a violation of unidimensionality when there are 500 persons and 30 items. The cut-point of 1.5 is often used beyond this specific condition of sample size and test length. This study argues that a fixed cut-point is not applicable because the distribution of eigenvalues or their ratios depends on sample size and test length, just like other statistics. The authors conducted a series of simulations to verify this argument. They then proposed three chi-square statistics for multivariate independence to test the correlation matrix obtained from the standardized residuals. Through simulations, it was found that Steiger's statistic behaved fairly like a chi-square distribution, when its degrees of freedom were adjusted.},

Furthermore, we construct a robust version of Cronbach's alpha which is insensitive to a small proportion of data that belong to a different source. The idea is that the robust Cronbach's alpha reflects the reliability of the bulk of the data. For example, it should not be possible that some small amount of outliers makes a score look reliable if it is not.},

  abstract = {Computationally intensive structural equation modeling (SEM) approaches have been in development over much of the 20th century, initiated by the seminal work of Sewall Wright. To this day, sample size requirements remain a vexing question in SEM based studies. Complexities which increase information demands in structural model estimation increase with the number of potential combinations of latent variables; while the information supplied for estimation increases with the number of measured parameters times the number of observations in the sample size -- both are non-linear. This alone would imply that requisite sample size is not a linear function solely of indicator count, even though such heuristics are widely invoked in justifying SEM sample size. This paper develops two lower bounds on sample size in SEM, the first as a function of the ratio of indicator variables to latent variables, and the second as a function of minimum effect, power and significance. The algorithm is applied to a meta-study of a set of research published in five of the top MIS journals. The study shows a systematic bias towards choosing sample sizes that are significantly too small. Actual sample sizes averaged only 50\% of the minimum needed to draw the conclusions the studies claimed. Overall, 80\% of the research articles in the meta-study drew conclusions from insufficient samples. Lacking accurate sample size information, researchers are inclined to economize on sample collection with inadequate samples that hurt the credibility of research conclusions. Guidelines are provided for applying the algorithms developed in this study, and companion software encapsulating the paper's formulae is made available for download.},

Based on this, we propose that psychological distance will influence the effect of risk versus efficacy framing on climate change engagement. In particular, risk perception related to the end-state expectancy of climate change mitigation should influence people's climate change engagement at farther distance. In contrast, efficacy perception related to the perceived feasibility of attaining end-state goals should influence engagement at closer distance. Results from an experimental survey based on a national sample that is both demographically and geographically representative (N = 1,282) supported our proposition. At closer spatial distance, perceived efficacy boosted by efficacy framing increased participants' intention to perform climate mitigation behaviors. In contrast, at farther distance, risk framing increased behavioral intention through heightened risk perception. Based on these findings, we suggest that when communicating distant and abstract risks, highlighting their disastrous impacts may better motivate action. In contrast, when communicating impending and concrete risks, stressing the feasibility of action may have stronger motivational potential.},

However, the specific form of informal social control investigated in B{\"o}ckenholt and van der Heijden's study (the perceived approval/disapproval of friends and family) is not the only kind of informal social control that has proven effective in spurring compliance. Descriptive social norms, which involve perceptions not of what others approve but of what others actually do, also influence compliance decisions powerfully. Yet, the role of descriptive social norms in rule adherence is often underappreciated by governed and governors alike. The consequences of this relative lack of recognition are discussed within the arena of compliance with pro-environmental regulations and requests.},

Exploratory factor analysis of our item pool revealed a four-factor structure, with cognitive-emotional impairment, functional impairment, behavioral engagement, and experience emerging as unique factors. Cognitive-emotional impairment and functional impairment were considered to constitute subscales for climate change anxiety; along with behavioral engagement, they were all related to experience as well as to negative emotions. Neither climate change anxiety nor general depression and anxiety were related to behavioral engagement. Study 2 replicated the factor structure as well as the pattern of correlations in a second MTurk sample of 199. Study 3 examined the relationship between climate change anxiety and adaptation responses in a sample of 217, and tested whether climate change anxiety scores would be affected by the framing of a climate change message. Overall, results suggest that climate change anxiety is not uncommon, especially among younger adults; that worry can be differentiated from a more serious impact on one's life; and that climate change anxiety is correlated with emotional but not behavioral responses to climate change.},

This study revised the EID scale and tested it in five countries (four continents) with a total sample size of 1717 participants. Results support strong internal consistency across all locations. Importantly, EID was significantly correlated with behavior and with environmental concern. This research gives us greater confidence that the EID construct is meaningful across different cultural contexts. Because the revised EID was designed to be relevant to a wider range of people and experiences, it is recommended as a replacement for the 2003 version.},

  abstract = {In practice, the inclusion of correlated residuals in latent-variable models is often regarded as a statistical sleight of hand, if not an outright form of cheating. Consequently, researchers have tended to allow only as many correlated residuals in their models as are needed to obtain a good fit to the data. The current article demonstrates that this strategy leads to the underinclusion of residual correlations that are completely justified on the basis of measurement theory and research design. In many designs, the absence of such correlations will not substantially harm the fit of the model; however, failure to include them can change the meaning of the extracted latent variables and generate potentially misleading results. Recommendations include (a) returning to the full multitrait--multimethod design when measurement theory implies the existence of shared method variance and (b) abandoning the evil-but-necessary attitude toward correlated residuals when they reflect intended features of the research design.},

From this perspective. a mediated process is a chain reaction, beginning with an independent variable that affects a mediator that in turn affects an outcome. The definition of mediation offered here, presented for stage sequences, states three conditions for establishing mediation: (a) the independent variable affects the probability of the sequence no mediator to mediator to outcome; (b) the independent variable affects the probability of a transition into the mediator stage; (c) the mediator affects the probability of a transition into the outcome stage at every level of the independent variable. This definition of mediation is compared and contrasted with the well-known definition of mediation for continuous variables discussed in Baron and Kenny (1986), Judd and Kenny (1981), and Kenny, Kashy, and Bolger (1997). The definition presented in this article emphasizes the intraindividual, time-ordered nature of mediation.},

  abstract = {Belief polarization is said to occur when two people respond to the same evidence by updating their beliefs in opposite directions. This response is considered to be ``irrational'' because it involves contrary updating, a form of belief updating that appears to violate normatively optimal responding, as for example dictated by Bayes' theorem. In light of much evidence that people are capable of normatively optimal behavior, belief polarization presents a puzzling exception. We show that Bayesian networks, or Bayes nets, can simulate rational belief updating. When fit to experimental data, Bayes nets can help identify the factors that contribute to polarization. We present a study into belief updating concerning the reality of climate change in response to information about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming (AGW). The study used representative samples of Australian and U.S. participants. Among Australians, consensus information partially neutralized the influence of worldview, with free-market supporters showing a greater increase in acceptance of human-caused global warming relative to free-market opponents. In contrast, while consensus information overall had a positive effect on perceived consensus among U.S. participants, there was a reduction in perceived consensus and acceptance of human-caused global warming for strong supporters of unregulated free markets. Fitting a Bayes net model to the data indicated that under a Bayesian framework, free-market support is a significant driver of beliefs about climate change and trust in climate scientists. Further, active distrust of climate scientists among a small number of U.S. conservatives drives contrary updating in response to consensus information among this particular group.},

In an experimental study, we measured participants' scepticism about climate change before and after reading two newspaper editorials that made opposing claims about the reality and seriousness of climate change (designed to generate uncertainty). A well-established social psychological finding is that people with opposing attitudes often assimilate evidence in a way that is biased towards their existing attitudinal position, which may lead to attitude polarisation. We found that people who were less sceptical about climate change evaluated the convincingness and reliability of the editorials in a markedly different way to people who were more sceptical about climate change, demonstrating biased assimilation of the information. In both groups, attitudes towards climate change became significantly more sceptical after reading the editorials, but we observed no evidence of attitude polarisation---that is, the attitudes of these two groups did not diverge. The results are the first application of the well-established assimilation and polarisation paradigm to attitudes about climate change, with important implications for anticipating how uncertainty---in the form of conflicting information---may impact on public engagement with climate change.},

A model of conservation behaviors was tested in which self-reports and observations were predicted by dispositional factors (beliefs, motives and competencies) assessed verbally, nonverbally, or in combination. Results revealed that beliefs (assessed verbally) only predicted the self-reported conservation, while competencies (assessed nonverbally) were only related to observed behavior. Motives (assessed verbally and nonverbally) predicted both the self-reported and observed re-use. These results indicate that competencies are more indicative of instrumental (observed) behavior, while beliefs are more related to a `reality' of social conventions and desires, which directs verbal self-reports.},

Two kinds of self-report were obtained: frequency of reuse self-reports and quantity of reuse self-reports. Thus, patterns of reuse of each particular type of material were assessed using the three methods of measurement. A multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) matrix of correlations between the reuse of these three materials, using these three methods of measurement, was analyzed. This matrix revealed the convergent and discriminant validities for the assessments of reuse. Higher correlations between direct observations and quantity self-reports were obtained than between observations and frequency reports. A confirmatory factor analysis of the MTMM matrix confirmed those results, adding significance testing to the validity assessment and to the partitioning of trait and method variance, modeled as latent factors.},

Methods for incorporating interactions into latent variable models have existed since at least Kenny and Judd, and a great many articles and books have developed these methods further. In the present article, we present an empirical review of the methods that organizational science investigators use to test their interaction hypotheses. We show that it is very common for investigators to use fully latent methods to test additive portions of their models, but to abandon such methods when testing the multiplicative portions of their models. By contrast, investigators whose models do not contain interactions tend to stick with fully latent methods throughout. As there is little rational basis for this pattern, it is likely due to continued discomfort regarding the proper application of existing fully latent methods. Thus, we end by offering R code that implements some of the more sophisticated fully latent approaches, and by offering a sequence of decisions that investigators can follow in order to choose the best analytic approach.},

This is the case even in temperate regions such as the United Kingdom (UK) where flooding and heat waves are forecast to become more common. We conducted a systematic review to quantify the prevalence and describe the causes of common mental health problems in populations exposed to extreme weather events in the UK. We searched Web of Science, EMBASE and PsycINFO for studies that measured the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in populations exposed to extreme weather events in the UK, published up to 12 December 2019. We included 17 studies, four of which were included in meta-analyses to determine the point prevalence of common mental health problems in the period within 12 months following extreme weather events. The point prevalence was 19.8\% for anxiety (k = 4; n = 1458; 95\% CI 7.42 to 32.15), 21.35\% for depression (k = 4; n = 1458; 95\% CI 9.04 to 33.65) and 30.36\% for PTSD (k = 4; n = 1359; 95\% CI 11.68 to 49.05). Key factors that affected mental ill health in people exposed to flooding were water depth and absence of flood warnings. Displacement from home underscored the narratives associated with people's perceptions of the impact of flooding. The high prevalence of common mental health problems suggests that the prevention of mental ill health in populations at risk or exposed to extreme weather events should be a UK public health priority.},

Few studies have investigated individual socioeconomic and racial/ethnic differences in public risk perceptions of the health hazards associated with extreme heat events, which are now increasing due to climate change. This study uses multilevel statistical modeling to investigate individual- and geographic-level (e.g., census tract level and regional) social, economic, and biophysical influences on public perceptions of the adverse health impacts associated with heat waves. Political orientation and climate change beliefs are the strongest predictors of heat wave health risk perceptions; household income also has a relatively strong and consistent effect. Contextual socioeconomic vulnerability, measured with a social vulnerability index at the census tract level, also significantly affects heat wave risk perceptions. The strong influence of political orientation and climate beliefs on perceptions of adverse health impacts from heat waves suggests that ideological predispositions can increase vulnerability to climate change.},

This study matches geo-located responses to a nationally representative survey of US residents with climate extremes data in order to investigate the social and physical factors shaping public views about the links between global warming and extreme weather. Specifically, regional-level Climate Extremes Indices (CEI) are modelled together with individual-level socio-demographic characteristics and an indicator of coastal residence to test whether the incidence of extreme events and proximity to the coasts, net of social and economic factors, correspond to increased perceptions that global warming has affected the weather. Results indicate that coastal shoreline county residence significantly predicts individuals' beliefs about the extent to which global warming is affecting the weather.},

The empirical analysis is based on unique data from a survey among more than 1000 adults in five Chinese cities. In line with former studies, our results reveal that the vast majority of almost 90\% of the Chinese respondents believes in the existence of global warming. This seems to be a convenient and necessary basis for the support of costly public adaptation activities in China. Our econometric analysis reveals that already perceived experiences with extreme weather events (and particularly heatwaves) alone are strongly correlated with climate change beliefs and that physical or financial damages due to these events lead to even stronger relationships. Our estimation results additionally suggest females as well as people with a lower education, in medium ages, with higher household incomes, and from Chengdu or Shenyang to be more skeptical toward the existence of climate change.},

  abstract = {Background: Extreme heat is a leading weather-related cause of mortality in the United States, but little guidance is available regarding how temperature variable selection impacts heat--mortality relationships. Objectives: We examined how the strength of the relationship between daily heat-related mortality and temperature varies as a function of temperature observation time, lag, and calculation method. Methods: Long time series of daily mortality counts and hourly temperature for seven U.S. cities with different climates were examined using a generalized additive model. The temperature effect was modeled separately for each hour of the day (with up to 3-day lags) along with different methods of calculating daily maximum, minimum, and mean temperature. We estimated the temperature effect on mortality for each variable by comparing the 99th versus 85th temperature percentiles, as determined from the annual time series. Results: In three northern cities (Boston, MA; Philadelphia, PA; and Seattle, WA) that appeared to have the greatest sensitivity to heat, hourly estimates were consistent with a diurnal pattern in the heat-mortality response, with strongest associations for afternoon or maximum temperature at lag 0 (day of death) or afternoon and evening of lag 1 (day before death). In warmer, southern cities, stronger associations were found with morning temperatures, but overall the relationships were weaker. The strongest temperature--mortality relationships were associated with maximum temperature, although mean temperature results were comparable. Conclusions: There were systematic and substantial differences in the association between temperature and mortality based on the time and type of temperature observation. Because the strongest hourly temperature--mortality relationships were not always found at times typically associated with daily maximum temperatures, temperature variables should be selected independently for each study location. In general, heat-mortality was more closely coupled to afternoon and maximum temperatures in most cities we examined, particularly those typically prone to heat-related mortality.

  abstract = {Item response theory (IRT) is a psychometric modeling paradigm used for the measurement of psychological constructs. In its simplest form an IRT model contains a single continuous latent variable that represents the construct of interest (e.g., mathematics proficiency, depression, social anxiety), which in turn is believed to determine a person's responses to a series of binary and/or polytomous questions. A typical IRT application produces an estimate of a person's location on the latent construct's continuum. However, IRT may also be used for other purposes, such as the design of an instrument with specific properties. Because IRT models are nonlinear, obtaining estimates of the latent person and item parameters involves numerically intensive (and typically iterative) algorithms. Various software packages, such as BILOG-MG, MULTILOG, NOHARM 4, PARSCALE, and WINSTEPS are available to provide parameter estimates. Technical treatments of IRT are provided by Baker and Kim (2004), Lord and Novick (1968), and van der Linden and Hambleton (1997). This chapter provides a brief description on IRT and Rasch modeling. It presents table describing the desiderata for IRT applications. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Taking this gap in research as a starting point, we investigate people's `emplaced' climate meanings with the approach of psychological distances (geographical, temporal and social). Using a grounded method and 36 semi-structured interviews with inhabitants of North Frisia (Germany) -- a region that has always been profoundly affected by environmental change -- we disentangle the different distances and proximities that permeate and create local climate change meanings. Overall, we demonstrate (1) the dynamic nature of psychological distances and proximities producing climate change meanings and we reveal (2) the importance of a place-based approach for analysing the abstract entity of climate change.},

Does experiencing increased frequency of tropical disasters or suffering increased personal damage from tropical disasters affect Republicans' concern about climate change and their attitudes toward climate policy? Using administrative voter file data and an original representative survey of Florida registered voters, we find that experiencing disasters and especially suffering greater damage is associated with greater concerns about climate change and support for climate mitigation policies. Republicans who personally experienced damage from tropical disasters are more concerned about climate change and show greater support for climate mitigation policies compared to co-partisans who did not suffer any damage. These results hold also when we substitute conservatives for Republicans in the analyses. Overall, our findings qualify the conventional wisdom that Republicans are unconcerned with climate change and demonstrate how they can support climate action.},

  abstract = {The influence of human behavior on climate change and environmental decline is receiving increased attention; and therefore, it has led to an increase in studies that measure pro-environmental behavior (PEB) as a predictor, a covariate, or an outcome variable. To this end, (validated) self-report scales have traditionally been the main measurement tool, but lately, several experimental instruments have also been developed to measure PEB. Measurement instruments that are considered to measure the same construct should provide consistent results, i.e., they should show high convergent validity. However, it is not clear whether substitute measures for PEB show this necessary convergent validity and how they compare to each other in terms of internal consistency and respondent experience. To address this, we investigated thirteen validated self-report scales and three experimental tasks on their psychometric qualities (i.e., validity and internal consistency) and respondent experience. Therefore, we assigned 340 participants and randomly administered half of the instruments to each of them. The results show that, in general, convergent validity is lacking, which shows that the measurement instruments cannot be considered equivalent. As for respondent experience, the experimental tasks are most time-consuming, are perceived as most fatiguing, and are most sensitive to multitasking. The self-report scales are most sensitive to socially desirable responding and acquiescence bias. Our insights cater to researchers in environmental psychology and sustainability seeking to employ validated self-report scales or behavioral tasks in measuring PEB.},

The CTT true score simply indicates the expected value of the observed score over repeated testings under the same conditions. Conceptually, many people would think of true score as an examinee's score under ideal testing conditions---what the examinee could do if motivated and not anxious or distracted. But that is not what true score means in CTT. Strong true-score theory (STT) provides an alternative to CTT. The strong in STT refers to the assumptions, which are stronger than those of CTT. In STT, one has to assume a given distribution for the error variance, and often for the true-score variance as well. This chapter provides an overview of CTT, STT as a variant of CTT with stronger assumptions and a focus on items instead of test scores, and generalizability theory as an extension of CTT.

The UK winter flooding offered a natural experiment to examine this question in detail. We compare individuals personally affected by flooding (n\,=\,162) to a nationally representative sample (n\,=\,975). We show that direct experience of flooding leads to an overall increased salience of climate change, pronounced emotional responses and greater perceived personal vulnerability and risk perceptions. We also present the first evidence that direct flooding experience can give rise to behavioural intentions beyond individual sustainability actions, including support for mitigation policies, and personal climate adaptation in matters unrelated to the direct experience.},

This study, which utilizes survey data from coastal residents who are at risk from hurricanes, adds to understanding of past hazard experience in two ways. First, it examines six different aspects of people's past hurricane experiences and the relationships among them. Then, it draws on risk theories of behavioral responses to explore how these different experiences influence people's evacuation intentions for a hypothetical hurricane as mediated through multiple dimensions of risk perception (cognitive, negative affective) and efficacy beliefs (self efficacy, response efficacy). The results suggest that people can experience emotional or otherwise severe impacts from a hurricane even if they do not have experiences with evacuation, property damage, or financial loss. The results also reveal that different past hurricane experiences operated through different combinations of mediating variables to influence evacuation intentions. Some of these processes enhanced intentions; for instance, experience with evacuation, financial loss, or emotional impacts heightened negative affective risk perceptions, which increased evacuation intentions. Other processes dampened evacuation intentions; for instance, people with past hurricane-related emotional impacts had lower self efficacy, which decreased evacuation intentions. In some cases, these enhancing and dampening processes competed. Exploring people's different past weather experiences and the mechanisms by which they can influence future behaviors is important for more deeply understanding populations at risk and how they respond to weather threats.},

However, in-depth, evidence-based investigations of the relationships among individual perceptions, climatic disaster experiences, and daily behaviors regarding adaptation to climate change remain to be conducted. We obtained survey data from 488 respondents in southwestern China, a region prone to frequent and severe droughts, to assess factors that influence adaptive behaviors and to identify their pathways. We applied Construal Level Theory (CLT) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to differentiate between respondents' high-level abstract construals and their low-level concrete construals. We analyzed the influences of these two levels of perception, combined with drought experiences on water-saving behaviors. We developed a structural equation model to estimate the correlation coefficients of the latent and observed variables in the structural process linked to the respondents' adaptive behaviors. The results found that a concrete perception of saving water plays a more significant part than an abstract perception of climate change in prompting specific adaptive behaviors. Improving public perceptions of climate change might increase the desirability of adaptation, whereas improving perceptions of water saving might increase the feasibility of implementing adaptive measures. Experience influenced individual behaviors, but that influence was indirect through its effects on perceptions.},

Eight years of wind measurements were used to determine the worst-case (strongest) winds in 16 directions. Surface fire rate of spread was used to calculate evacuation trigger buffers for the communities of Julian and nearby Whispering Pines, and for three potential evacuation routes. Multiple trigger buffers were combined to create fire planning areas, and trigger buffers that predict the closure of all evacuation routes were explored. WUIVAC trigger buffers offer several potential benefits for strategic evacuation planning, including determination of when to evacuate and locating potential evacuation routes.},

  abstract = {Predictive modeling is becoming more popular in psychological science. Machine learning techniques have been used to develop prediction rules based on items of psychological tests. However, this approach does not take into account that these items are noisy indicators of the constructs they intend to measure. Structural equation modeling does take this into account. Several authors have concluded that it is impossible to make out-of-sample predictions based on a reflective structural equation model. We show that it is possible to make such predictions and we develop R-code to do so. With two empirical examples, we show that SEM-based prediction can outperform prediction based on linear regression models. With three simulation studies, we further investigate the SEM-based prediction rule and its robustness in comparison with predictions using regularized linear regression. We conclude that the new SEM-based prediction rule is robust against violation of the normality assumption but sensitive to model misspecification.},

  abstract = {It is widely recognised that public acceptability often poses a barrier towards renewable energy development. This article reviews existing research on public perceptions of wind energy, where opposition is typically characterized by the NIMBY (not in my back yard) concept. The objectives of the article are to provide a critical assessment of past research and an integrated, multidimensional framework to guide future work. Six distinct strands of research are identified, summarized and critiqued: public support for switching from conventional energy sources to wind energy; aspects of turbines associated with negative perceptions; the impact of physical proximity to turbines; acceptance over time of wind farms; NIMBYism as an explanation for negative perceptions; and, finally, the impact of local involvement on perceptions. Research across these strands is characterized by opinion poll studies of general beliefs and case studies of perceptions of specific developments. In both cases, research is fragmented and has failed to adequately explain, rather than merely describe, perceptual processes. The article argues for more theoretically informed empirical research, grounded in social science concepts and methods. A multidimensional framework is proposed that goes beyond the NIMBY label and integrates previous findings with social and environmental psychological theory.

We estimate the plasticity of 17 household action types in 5 behaviorally distinct categories by use of data on the most effective documented interventions that do not involve new regulatory measures. These interventions vary by type of action and typically combine several policy tools and strong social marketing. National implementation could save an estimated 123 million metric tons of carbon per year in year 10, which is 20\% of household direct emissions or 7.4\% of US national emissions, with little or no reduction in household well-being. The potential of household action deserves increased policy attention. Future analyses of this potential should incorporate behavioral as well as economic and engineering elements.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, reports of deforestation, mass extinctions, biodiversity loss, and emergencies like floods and droughts have clearly highlighted the impact of human activities on climate change. This underscores the need for significant lifestyle changes to mitigate this impact. Pro-environmental behavior (PEB) change involves adopting actions that protect the environment and reducing environmentally harmful activities to promote sustainability. While qualitative research may provide unique insights into PEB barriers that are challenging to capture through quantitative methods, reports of qualitative studies are scattered across different literatures with little integration. With the present review, we bring together qualitative studies on PEB barriers and examine whether those studies reveal barriers compatible with existing barrier frameworks from environmental psychology. We identified 38 qualitative studies on barriers to PEB change. Our analysis revealed that most of the barriers to individual pro-environmental action identified in qualitative studies align with environmental psychology frameworks. These barriers were experienced not only by individuals in their role as consumer or citizen, but also by community-level actors (e.g., seeking to implement pro-environmental policies) and industrial decision-makers (e.g., aiming to reduce the ecological footprint of their business activities). Our findings underscore the multifaceted nature of barriers to PEB change and emphasize the importance of addressing structural and institutional factors alongside individual-level interventions.},

  abstract = {Wildfire has been an important process affecting the Earth's surface and atmosphere for over 350 million years and human societies have coexisted with fire since their emergence. Yet many consider wildfire as an accelerating problem, with widely held perceptions both in the media and scientific papers of increasing fire occurrence, severity and resulting losses. However, important exceptions aside, the quantitative evidence available does not support these perceived overall trends. Instead, global area burned appears to have overall declined over past decades, and there is increasing evidence that there is less fire in the global landscape today than centuries ago. Regarding fire severity, limited data are available. For the western USA, they indicate little change overall, and also that area burned at high severity has overall declined compared to pre-European settlement. Direct fatalities from fire and economic losses also show no clear trends over the past three decades. Trends in indirect impacts, such as health problems from smoke or disruption to social functioning, remain insufficiently quantified to be examined. Global predictions for increased fire under a warming climate highlight the already urgent need for a more sustainable coexistence with fire. The data evaluation presented here aims to contribute to this by reducing misconceptions and facilitating a more informed understanding of the realities of global fire. This article is part of themed issue `The interaction of fire and mankind'.},

Attitudes about climate change have been attributed to a number of factors including personal values, political ideology, the media environment and personal experience. Recent studies have found evidence that the temperature can influence one's opinion about climate change and willingness to change behaviour and/or support climate policy. Although there is some evidence that individual cool or warm years have influenced large-scale opinion about climate change, the extent to which temperature can explain the past variability in public opinion and public discourse about climate change at the national level is not known. Here we isolate the relationship between opinion about climate change and temperature at the national scale, using data from opinion polls, a discourse analysis of opinion articles from five major daily newspapers, and a national air temperature database. The fraction of respondents to national polls who express ``belief in'' or ``worry about'' climate change is found to be significantly correlated to U.S. mean temperature anomalies over the previous 3--12~months. In addition, the fraction of editorial and opinion articles which ``agree'' with the expert consensus on climate change is also found to be significantly correlated to U.S. mean temperature anomalies at seasonal and annual scales. These results suggest that a fraction of the past variance in American views about climate change could potentially be explained by climate variability.},

This leads to biased parameter estimates when interactions are present in a dataset. With the aim of providing an imputation method which preserves interactions in the data automatically, the use of recursive partitioning as imputation method is examined. Three recursive partitioning techniques are implemented in the multiple imputation by chained equations framework. It is investigated, using simulated data, whether recursive partitioning creates appropriate variability between imputations and unbiased parameter estimates with appropriate confidence intervals. It is concluded that, when interaction effects are present in a dataset, substantial gains are possible by using recursive partitioning for imputation compared to standard applications. In addition, it is shown that the potential of recursive partitioning imputation approaches depends on the relevance of a possible interaction effect, the correlation structure of the data, and the type of possible interaction effect present in the data.},

Unfortunately, these approaches have important shortcomings that conceal the nature of the moderated and the mediated effects under investigation. This article presents a general analytical framework for combining moderation and mediation that integrates moderated regression analysis and path analysis. This framework clarifies how moderator variables influence the paths that constitute the direct, indirect, and total effects of mediated models. The authors empirically illustrate this framework and give step-by-step instructions for estimation and interpretation. They summarize the advantages of their framework over current approaches, explain how it subsumes moderated mediation and mediated moderation, and describe how it can accommodate additional moderator and mediator variables, curvilinear relationships, and structural equation models with latent variables.},

It has been difficult to explore this question using observational data, because individuals are typically exposed to experiences in a selective fashion, and self-reports of exposure may be biased and unreliable. In this study, we identify one experience to which Americans are exposed nearly at random---their local weather---and show that weather patterns have a significant effect on people's beliefs about the evidence for global warming.}

A direct estimate of a tornado's power is difficult and dangerous to get. An indirect estimate on a categorical scale is available from a post-storm survery of the damage. Wind speed bounds are attached to the scale, but the scale is not adequate for analyzing trends in tornado intensity separate from trends in tornado frequency. Here tornado intensity on a continuum is estimated from damage path length and width, which are measured on continuous scales and correlated to the EF rating. The wind speeds on the EF scale are treated as interval censored data and regressed onto the path dimensions and fatalities. The regression model indicates a 25\% increase in expected intensity over a threshold intensity of 29 m s-1 for a 100 km increase in path length and a 17\% increase in expected intensity for a one km increase in path width. The model shows a 43\% increase in the expected intensity when fatalities are observed controlling for path dimensions. The estimated wind speeds correlate at a level of .77 (.34, .93) [95\% confidence interval] with a small sample of wind speeds estimated independently from a doppler radar calibration. The estimated wind speeds allow analyses to be done on the tornado database that are not possible with the categorical scale. The modeled intensities can be used in climatology and in environmental and engineering applications. Research is needed to understand the upward trends in path length and width.},

There is evidence to suggest that data are adversely affected by bias from underreporting. This bias affects the validity of measures of consumption of alcohol and can have deleterious effects on the results of some forms of statistical estimation. Data for this study were collected at an isolated military base. The remoteness of this site and the fact that it is a military station made it possible to estimate the actual level of consumption of alcohol for the population by assessing apparent consumption through officially recorded sales of alcohol. The results of eight measures of consumption of alcohol were compared with apparent consumption, as established by documented sales, and the validity and reliability of the various measures were determined using the classical correlational approach. The validity and reliability of the data generated by the self-report survey were also analyzed using LISREL, the measurement model in particular. The results indicate that various instruments used to assess the consumption of alcohol produce very different outcomes in terms of their validity and reliability, some questions being considerably more valid and reliable than others. Two of the more salient characteristics of questions that affect validity and reliability were isolated, namely a question's ability to aid recall and its ability to mitigate the effects of persons providing socially desirable responses. The LISREL results show that these are two underlying factors for the measurement of the consumption of alcohol. It is concluded that questions that produce valid and reliable responses do so for identifiable reasons, and measurement instruments can be improved by incorporating particular features.}

At that time, online survey research was in its early stages. Also covered are the present and future states of online research. Many conclusions and recommendations are presented. Design/methodology/approach The look back focuses on online surveys, strengths and weaknesses of online surveys, the literature on several aspects of online surveys and online survey best practices. The look ahead focuses on emerging survey technologies and methodologies, and new non-survey technologies and methodologies. Conclusions and recommendations are provided. Findings Online survey research is used more frequently and better accepted by researchers than in 2005. Yet, survey techniques are still regularly transformed by new technologies. Non-survey digital research is also more prominent than in 2005 and can better track actual behavior than surveys can. Hybrid surveys will be widespread in the future. Practical implications The paper aims to provide insights for researchers with different levels of online survey experience. And both academics and practitioners should gain insights. Social implications Adhering to a strong ethics code is vital to gain respondents' trust and to produce valid results. Originality/value Conclusions and recommendations are offered in these specific areas: defining concepts, understanding the future role of surveys, developing and implementing surveys and a survey code of ethics. The literature review cites more than 200 sources.},

The study focused on two issues: (a) What are the empirical relationships between IRT- and CTT-based item and person statistics? and (b) To what extent are the item statistics from IRT and those from CIT invariant across different participant samples? A large-scale statewide assessment database was used in the study. The findings indicate that the person and item statistics derived from the two measurement frameworks are quite comparable. The degree of invariance of item statistics across samples, usually considered as the theoretical superiority IRT models, also appeared to be similar for the two measurement fireworks.},

Papers are less likely to be published and to be cited if they report ``negative'' results (results that fail to support the tested hypothesis). Therefore, if publication pressures increase scientific bias, the frequency of ``positive'' results in the literature should be higher in the more competitive and ``productive'' academic environments. This study verified this hypothesis by measuring the frequency of positive results in a large random sample of papers with a corresponding author based in the US. Across all disciplines, papers were more likely to support a tested hypothesis if their corresponding authors were working in states that, according to NSF data, produced more academic papers per capita. The size of this effect increased when controlling for state's per capita R\&D expenditure and for study characteristics that previous research showed to correlate with the frequency of positive results, including discipline and methodology. Although the confounding effect of institutions' prestige could not be excluded (researchers in the more productive universities could be the most clever and successful in their experiments), these results support the hypothesis that competitive academic environments increase not only scientists' productivity but also their bias. The same phenomenon might be observed in other countries where academic competition and pressures to publish are high.},

  abstract = {Livestock rearing is the most important agricultural activity in global drylands, making forage supply an essential ecosystem service (ES). Most drylands are expected to experience increasing levels of climatic aridity and land-use pressure in the future. As few studies account for combined effects of these global change drivers, we still have a limited understanding of how these drivers jointly shape forage supply. Here, the concept of social-ecological systems (SESs) is useful, as it helps to formalize the complex interrelationships of drivers. Taking advantage of steep gradients of climatic aridity and land-use pressure in West Africa, a crossed space-for-time substitution was applied to capture combined effects of climate and land-use change on forage supply. We have operationalized the SES concept via structural equation modelling, and analysed how drivers directly or indirectly affected forage quantity, quality and their integrated proxy (metabolisable energy yield). Results demonstrate that contemporary dryland SESs are mainly controlled by land-use, which has often been used as a proxy for other variables, such as climatic aridity. Aridity was also directly linked to a higher risk of vegetation degradation, indicating that future drylands will be less resilient to grazing pressures. The importance of land-use drivers for ES provision implies that sustainable grazing management could potentially mitigate detrimental climate change effects. However, model effects mediated by intermediate variables, such as aridity, short-term vegetation dynamics, and weather fluctuations, make it extremely difficult to predict climate change effects on ESs. Integrating structural equation modelling into the well-defined SES concept is thus highly useful to disentangle complex interdependencies of global change drivers in dryland rangelands, and to analyze drivers' direct and indirect effects on ESs. Our novel approach can thus foster a deeper understanding of patterns and mechanisms driving ecosystem service supply in drylands, which is essential for establishing sustainable management under conditions of global change.},

  abstract = {Although many people are concerned about climate change, active public support for ambitious policies is still lagging behind. How can this gap be closed? Recent work has theorized that the perceived urgency of climate change drives public support for climate policy, but this lacks empirical evidence. Using advanced sparse regressions and comparative survey-embedded framing experiments with 9,911 eligible voters in Germany and the United States, we empirically studied the role of perceived urgency. Our study provides two findings. First, although perceived urgency is key in driving support for ``low-cost'' mitigation policies, it does not lead to more support for ``high-cost'' mitigation policies where the behavioral implications are visible. Second, while temporal reframing does not increase policy support or feelings of dread, context information about demand-side mitigation increases support for such costly climate policies. The results are particularly relevant for democracies, where ambitious policies require the support of citizens.},

  abstract = {Despite the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change and its implications, there is considerably less certainty or strength of belief among the general public in some industrialised countries. One explanation for the lack of consensus is the partisan nature of political debate about climate change. A survey of Australian politicians demonstrates that political party affiliation and ideology have a powerful influence on climate change beliefs. Politicians from Labor and Green parties (centre-left and progressive parties) exhibited beliefs that were more consistent with scientific consensus about climate change than non-aligned or conservative leaders. Moreover, political ideology (left--right) emerged as the most important predictor of politicians' climate change beliefs. These findings highlight the role of political partisanship and ideology in undermining consensus around climate change and suggest the need to build consensus through constructing climate change messages that appeal to closely held values and which advance the discussion of solutions along non-partisan lines.},

Fear as a psychological construct concerning climate change is not well understood. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted, targeting a demographically representative sample of Americans (n = 546) in terms of ethnicity, age, and gender. Survey questions included demographic information and global questions regarding self-rated anxiety and fear of climate change. Ordinal logistic models were created to determine which demographic factors were most predictive of climate change fear in the US population. Over half of the study sample (50.9\%) indicated being moderately or very afraid of climate change. In the end, only three factors remained significant (p {$<$} 0.001) in the model; self-reported level of anxiety, political affiliation, and identifying and Hispanic/Latino. Climate change fear is still not understood, especially in terms of its impact on the mental health of the population in general, though prolonged fear can be an antecedent to other mental health disorders. This study had demonstrated that fear of climate change impacts over half of the U.S population. Level of fear differs significantly by demographic. This study has provided evidence that climate change fear impacts a significant proportion of the US population, prompting a need to investigate the potential acute and long-term impacts of this fear on the human psyche. The harms and benefits of the fear response to climate change should be explored as well as potential responses to fear due to climate change.},

  abstract = {In the context of item response theory (IRT), linking the scales of two measurement points is a prerequisite to examine a change in competence over time. In educational large-scale assessments, non-identical test forms sharing a number of anchor-items are frequently scaled and linked using two- or three-parametric item response models. However, if item pools are limited and/or sample sizes are small to medium, the sparser Rasch model is a suitable alternative regarding the precision of parameter estimation. As the Rasch model implies stricter assumptions about the response process, a violation of these assumptions may manifest as model misfit in form of item discrimination parameters empirically deviating from their fixed value of one. The present simulation study investigated the performance of four IRT linking methods---fixed parameter calibration, mean/mean linking, weighted mean/mean linking, and concurrent calibration---applied to Rasch-scaled data with a small item pool. Moreover, the number of anchor items required in the absence/presence of moderate model misfit was investigated in small to medium sample sizes. Effects on the link outcome were operationalized as bias, relative bias, and root mean square error of the estimated sample mean and variance of the latent variable. In the light of this limited context, concurrent calibration had substantial convergence issues, while the other methods resulted in an overall satisfying and similar parameter recovery---even in the presence of moderate model misfit. Our findings suggest that in case of model misfit, the share of anchor items should exceed 20\% as is currently proposed in the literature. Future studies should further investigate the effects of anchor item composition regarding unbalanced model misfit.},

In this Tutorial, I alleviate this potential confusion by describing alternative forms of omega and providing guidelines for choosing an appropriate omega estimate pertaining to the measurement of a target construct represented with a confirmatory factor analysis model. Several applied examples demonstrate how to compute different forms of omega in R.},

In general, increases in threat severity, threat vulnerability, response efficacy, and self-efficacy facilitated adaptive intentions or behaviors. Conversely, decreases in maladaptive response rewards and adaptive response costs increased adaptive intentions or behaviors. This held true whether the measures were based on intentions or behaviors, and suggests that PMT components may be useful for individual and community interventions.},

This approach leaves the practitioner to choose the PIs to be included in the model, introducing arbitrariness into the modeling. In contrast to previous Monte Carlo studies, we evaluated the PI approach by 3 post hoc analyses applied to a real-world case adopted from a research effort in social psychology. The measurement design applied 3 and 4 indicators for the 2 latent 1st-order variables, leaving the researcher with a choice among more than 4,000 possible PI configurations. Sixty so-called matched-pair configurations that have been recommended in previous literature are of special interest. In the 1st post hoc analysis we estimated the interaction effect for all PI configurations, keeping the real-world sample fixed. The estimated interaction effect was substantially affected by the choice of PIs, also across matched-pair configurations. Subsequently, a post hoc Monte Carlo study was conducted, with varying sample sizes and data distributions. Convergence, bias, Type I error and power of the interaction test were investigated for each matched-pair configuration and the all-pairs configuration. Variation in estimates across matched-pair configurations for a typical sample was substantial. The choice of specific configuration significantly affected convergence and the interaction test's outcome. The all-pairs configuration performed overall better than the matched-pair configurations. A further advantage of the all-pairs over the matched-pairs approach is its unambiguity. The final study evaluates the all-pairs configuration for small sample sizes and compares it to the non-PI approach of latent moderated structural equations.},

This kind of influence is expected to hold particular relevance when dealing with individual behaviors that have spatially defined collective implications. Participants were 452 residents of various Italian cities, who filled in a questionnaire measuring intentions to recycle, attitudes towards recycling, perceived behavioral control, and 4 kinds of norms stemming from a 2 x 2 combination (i.e., injunctive vs. descriptive, and subjective vs. local norms). Structural equation modelling analyses confirmed the empirical distinction of the 4 kinds of norms, and showed their independent effects on recycling intentions. In particular, descriptive norms (both subjective and local) emerged as powerful predictors of the target proenvironmental behavior, both directly and indirectly through their influence on perceived behavioral control. The implications of the distinction among different kinds of social norms and their relationship with the other dimensions are discussed.},

The assumption that positive affective bonds with one's place should be associated with systematic behavioral tendencies to protect that place is more or less explicitly evidenced in various theoretical frameworks, and this is consistent with research literature where place attachment predicts social cohesion and wellbeing, community involvement, and civic participation. Place attachment has shown to influence positively pro-environmental behaviors, particularly those ones that reduce human impacts on the environment (i.e., the ``mitigation'' behaviors), whereas a more complex picture has emerged for ``adaptation'' behaviors in environmental risk situations, since a high place attachment could reduce the likelihood of proper coping choices in case of high perceived risk. Recent research has highlighted the role of place attachment also in tourism and heritage sites' choices and related behaviors. Despite the amount of evidence about the positive influence of place attachment (or of some of its components in multidimensional approaches) on pro-environmental behaviors, there are also cases where a high place attachment was found associated to anti-environmental attitudes and actions (e.g., protest against environmental regulations which are perceived to contrast local identity and/or economic interests).},

Utilizing matrix algebra and Isserlis's Theorem, we offer a revised approach that no longer relies on this assumption, thereby improving the calculation accuracy and subsequent visualization of endogenous moderation.

  abstract = {Inferring human mental state (e.g., emotion, depression, engagement) with sensing technology is one of the most valuable challenges in the affective computing area, which has a profound impact in all industries interacting with humans. Self-report is the most common way to quantify how people think, but prone to subjectivity and various responses bias. It is usually used as the ground truth for human mental state prediction. In recent years, many data-driven machine learning models are built based on self-report annotations as the target value. In this research, we investigate the reliability of self-report data in the wild by studying the confidence level of responses and survey completion time. We conduct a case study (i.e., student engagement inference) by recruiting 23 students in a high school setting over a period of 4 weeks. Overall, our participants volunteered 488 self-reported responses and sensing data from smart wristbands. We find that the physiologically measured student engagement and perceived student engagement are not always consistent. The findings from this research have great potential to benefit future studies in predicting engagement, depression, stress, and other emotion-related states in the field of affective computing and sensing technologies.},

It develops a framework for addressing key questions about human behaviors that harm the environment, summarizes knowledge from psychology and related fields about these behaviors, and uses that knowledge to point the way to realistic solutions.  This book develops a framework for addressing these questions, drawing on behavioral theory, real world case studies, field experiments, and other evidence. Because its central focus is individual behavior, it draws most heavily on concepts from social, cognitive, and behavioral psychology. However, it puts behavior in the context of the economic, institutional, and policy forces that shape it and emphasizes arenas where individual action makes a real difference to the natural environment. The result is an interdisciplinary treatment, rooted in behavioral science but addressing practical issues of environmental policy.  The book is written at a level suitable for undergraduate students in psychology, social science, and environmental studies and science. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Engagement in individual (e.g., eating less meat, electric car use) and collective (e.g., petition signing, donating money to environmental causes) sustainability behaviors may correlate with psychological factors including emotions, worry about climate change and natural hazards, and response efficacy. However, little research has explored these relationships in representative samples at high risk for climate-related hazard exposures (e.g., hurricanes, heatwaves, flooding). We assessed climate~change-related sustainability behaviors in an ongoing, probability-based representative survey of 1479 Texas and Florida residents repeatedly exposed to climate-related hazards including hurricanes, heatwaves, flooding, and tornadoes. Controlling for demographics, behavior-related positive and negative emotions correlated with engagement in performing a~greater number of collective-level sustainability behaviors (positive emotions: IRR\,=\,2.06, p\,{$<$}\,.001; negative emotions: IRR\,=\,1.46, p\,=\,.030).~ However, negative emotions were mediated by natural hazard worry, which in turn was mediated by climate change worry. Positive emotions were mediated by response efficacy. Individual-level sustainability behaviors were associated with positive emotions (IRR\,=\,1.18, p\,{$<$}\,.001), which were again mediated by response efficacy.   In adjusted analyses unpacking the relationship between discrete emotions and sustainability behaviors, hope was associated with individual- and collective-level sustainability behaviors (all ps\,{$<$}\,.05). Results suggest general climate change worry may be adaptive and that feelings of hope, relative to other emotions (both positive and negative), may help encourage sustainability behaviors that address climate change. Scalable interventions should explore leveraging these psychological experiences to promote uptake of~sustainable technology-related behaviors more broadly.},

All EF2--EF5 tornadoes [as measured on the enhanced Fujita (EF) scale], in addition to randomly selected EF0--EF1 tornadoes, were extracted from the SPC dataset, which yielded 1268 events for inclusion in the current study. Analysis of those data revealed similar values of the effective-layer significant tornado parameter for the longest-lived (60+ min) tornadic circulations, longest-tracked ({$\geq$}68 km) tornadoes, and widest tornadoes ({$\geq$}1.2 km). However, the widest tornadoes occurring west of -94{$^\circ$} longitude were associated with larger mean-layer convective available potential energy, storm-top divergence, and low-level rotational velocity. Furthermore, wide tornadoes occurred when low-level winds were out of the southeast, resulting in large low-level hodograph curvature and near-surface horizontal vorticity that was more purely streamwise when compared with long-lived and long-tracked events. On the other hand, tornado pathlength and longevity were maximized with eastward-migrating synoptic-scale cyclones associated with strong southwesterly wind profiles through much of the troposphere, fast storm motions, large values of bulk wind difference and storm-relative helicity, and lower buoyancy.},

An analysis of observed maximum changes in wind speed for Atlantic TCs from 1971 to 2020 indicates that TC intensification rates have already changed as anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have warmed the planet and oceans. Mean maximum TC intensification rates are up to 28.7\% greater in a modern era (2001--2020) compared to a historical era (1971--1990). In the modern era, it is about as likely for TCs to intensify by at least 50 kts in 24~h, and more likely for TCs to intensify by at least 20 kts within 24~h than it was for TCs to intensify by these amounts in 36~h in the historical era. Finally, the number of TCs that intensify from a Category 1 hurricane (or weaker) into a major hurricane within 36 h has more than doubled in the modern era relative to the historical era. Significance tests suggest that it would have been statistically impossible to observe the number of TCs that intensified in this way during the modern era if rates of intensification had not changed from the historical era.},

  abstract = {Background Heat waves have been linked with an increase in mortality, but the associated risk has been only partly characterized. Methods We examined this association by decomposing the risk for temperature into a ``main effect'' due to independent effects of daily high temperatures, and an ``added'' effect due to sustained duration of heat during waves, using data from 108 communities in USA during 1987-2000. We adopted different definitions of heat-wave days based on combinations of temperature thresholds and days of duration. The main effect was estimated through distributed lag non-linear functions of temperature, which account for non-linear delayed effects and short-time harvesting. We defined the main effect as the relative risk between the median city-specific temperature during heat-wave days and the 75th percentile of the year-round distribution. The added effect was defined first using a simple indicator, and then a function of consecutive heat-wave days. City-specific main and added effects were pooled through univariate and multivariate meta-analytic techniques. Results The added wave effect was small (0.2\%-2.8\% excess relative risk, depending on wave definition) compared with the main effect (4.9\%-8.0\%), and was apparent only after 4 consecutive heat wave days. Conclusions Most of the excess risk with heat waves in the USA can be simply summarized as the independent effects of individual days' temperatures. A smaller added effect arises in heat waves lasting more than 4 days.},

Therefore, the results of these studies provide little insight into variables that could be helpful in reducing household environmental impact. In this article, an environmentally significant measure of household consumer behavior (i.e., combined direct and indirect energy use) is presented and compared with a common social science measure of proenvironmental behavior (based on popular notions of environmentally significant behavior). Two large-scale field studies were conducted among representative samples of Dutch households. The results showed respondents who indicate they behave more proenvironmentally do not necessarily use less energy. Also, proenvironmental behavior is more strongly related to attitudinal variables, whereas household energy use is primarily related to variables such as income and household size. More multidisciplinary research seems necessary to identify variables that influence the actual environmental impact of household consumer behavior.},

The ``lavaan'' packages in R and SPSS were used to analyze the data and test the proposed hypotheses. Findings The results reveal that sharing platforms' innovativeness is positively related to consumer trust, and this relationship is mediated by organizational legitimacy. Furthermore, sharing platforms' social worth moderates the relationship between firm innovativeness and organizational legitimacy as well as the indirect effect of firm innovativeness on consumer trust via organizational legitimacy. Practical implications This article proposes strategies that enable sharing platforms to increase consumer trust, which can also better promote the development of the sharing economy. Originality/value This paper contributes to the literature by focusing on the social attributes of the sharing economy. By building a more detailed model of consumer trust, this paper adds to the knowledge on the influencing mechanism of consumer trust in the sharing economy.},

  abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of 2 currently available physical activity surveys for assessing time spent in sedentary behavior (SB) in older adults. Methods: Fifty-eight adults ({$\geq$}65 years) completed the Yale Physical Activity Survey for Older Adults (YPAS) and Community Health Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) before and after a 10-day period during which they wore an ActiGraph accelerometer (ACC). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) examined test-retest reliability. Overall percent agreement and a kappa statistic examined YPAS validity. Lin's concordance correlation, Pearson correlation, and Bland-Altman analysis examined CHAMPS validity. Results: Both surveys had moderate test-retest reliability (ICC: YPAS = 0.59 (P {$<$} .001), CHAMPS = 0.64 (P {$<$} .001)) and significantly underestimated SB time. Agreement between YPAS and ACC was low ({$\kappa$} = -0.0003); however, there was a linear increase (P {$<$} .01) in ACC-derived SB time across YPAS response categories. There was poor agreement between ACC-derived SB and CHAMPS (Lin's r = .005; 95\% CI, -0.010 to 0.020), and no linear trend across CHAMPS quartiles (P = .53). Conclusions: Neither of the surveys should be used as the sole measure of SB in a study; though the YPAS has the ability to rank individuals, providing it with some merit for use in correlational SB research.},

Rumination allows cattle -- and other ruminant species -- to digest fibrous feeds that cannot be directly consumed by humans and thus to make a net positive contribution to food balances. This contribution is of particular importance in marginal areas, where agro-ecological conditions and weak infrastructures do not offer much alternative. It is also valuable where cattle convert crop residues and by-products into edible products and where they contribute to soil fertility through their impact on nutrients and organic matter cycles. At the same time, environmental sustainability issues are acute. They chiefly relate to the low efficiency of beef cattle in converting natural resources into edible products. Water use, land use, biomass appropriation and greenhouse gas emissions are for example typically higher per unit of edible product in beef systems than in any other livestock systems, even when corrected for nutritional quality. This particularly causes environmental pressure when production systems are specialized towards the delivery of edible products, in large volumes. The paper discusses environmental challenges at global level, recognizing the large diversity of systems. Beef production is faced with a range of additional sustainability challenges, such as changing consumer perceptions, resilience to climate change, animal health and inequities in access to land and water resources. Entry-points for environmental sustainability improvement are discussed within this broader development context.},

These robust statistics have not been examined in combination with LMS yet. In 2 Monte Carlo studies we investigate the performance of these methods for testing quadratic or interaction effects subject to different sources of nonnormality, nonnormality due to the nonlinear terms, and nonnormality due to the distribution of the predictor variables. The results indicate that TD is preferable to both TDR and TDRP. Under the condition of strong nonlinear effects and nonnormal predictors, TDR often produced negative differences and TDRP showed no desirable power.},

The results suggest that social norms predict each type of PEB, in contrast to other constructs in VBN theory, except for utility-saving behaviours. The findings also reveal some similarities as well as differences between Malays and Chinese, indicating that the two ethnic groups are not homogeneous. The study is the first to simultaneously study six types of PEB and to examine the differences between Malays and Chinese on PEB constructs and offers a valuable contribution to the literature by extending VBN theory to social norms and PEB.},

The human dimensions of climate change are discussed, followed by descriptions of key theoretical models for explaining and predicting climate-relevant behavior, issues and distinctions in studying human behavior in response to global climate change, an account of psychological (as opposed to structural) adaptation and its behavioral sequelae, the many psychological barriers to behavior change in this context, and behavior-focused intervention strategies. The overview concludes with suggestions for researchers interested in advancing knowledge about behavior change and psychological responses to climate change. When knowledge about human behavior, cognitions, and psychological adaptation is integrated with that produced by researchers in related social and natural science disciplines, the result will facilitate solutions to this massive shared challenge.},

  abstract = {Most people think climate change and sustainability are important problems, but too few global citizens engaged in high-greenhouse-gas-emitting behavior are engaged in enough mitigating behavior to stem the increasing flow of greenhouse gases and other environmental problems. Why is that? Structural barriers such as a climate-averse infrastructure are part of the answer, but psychological barriers also impede behavioral choices that would facilitate mitigation, adaptation, and environmental sustainability. Although many individuals are engaged in some ameliorative action, most could do more, but they are hindered by seven categories of psychological barriers, or " dragons of inaction" limited cognition about the problem, ideological worldviews that tend to preclude pro-environmental attitudes and behavior, comparisons with key other people, sunk costs and behavioral momentum, discredence toward experts and authorities, perceived risks of change, and positive but inadequate behavior change. Structural barriers must be removed wherever possible, but this is unlikely to be sufficient. Psychologists must work with other scientists, technical experts, and policymakers to help citizens overcome these psychological barriers. {\copyright} 2011 American Psychological Association.},

  abstract = {At a global level, climate change is expected to result in more frequent and higher-intensity weather events, with impacts ranging from inconvenient to catastrophic. The potential for disasters to act as ``focusing events'' for policy change, including adaptation to climate change risk, is well known. Moreover, local action is an important element of climate change adaptation and related risk management efforts. As such, there is a good reason to expect local communities to mobilize in response to disaster events, both with immediate response and recovery-focused activities, as well as longer-term preparedness and adaptation-focused public policy changes. However, scholars also note that the experience of disaster does not always yield policy change; indeed, disasters can also result in policy inertia and failure, perhaps as often or more often than major policy change. This study poses two key research questions. First, we ask to what degree policy change occurs in communities impacted by an extreme weather event. Second, we seek to understand the conditions that lead to adaptation-oriented policy adoption in response to an extreme weather event. Our results suggest two main recipes for future-oriented policy adoption in the wake of an extreme weather event. For both recipes, a high-impact event is a necessary condition for future-oriented policy adoption. In the first recipe for change, policy adoption occurs in Democratic communities with highly focused media attention. The second, less expected recipe for change involves Republican communities that have experienced other uncommon weather events in the recent past. We use a comparative case approach with 15 cases and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis methods. Our approach adds to the existing literature on policy change and local adaptation by selecting a mid-N range of cases where extreme weather events have the potential to act as focusing events, thereby sidestepping selection on the dependent variable. Our approach also takes advantage of a novel method for measuring attention, the latent Dirichlet allocation approach.},

Methods By partial credit model (PCM), we estimated CVSS17 measures and the standard error for every possible raw score, and used these data to determine the number of different performance levels in the CVSS17. In addition, through discriminant analysis, we checked that the scale's two main factors could classify subjects according to these determined levels of performance. Finally, a separate Rasch analysis was performed for each CVSS17 factor to assess their measurement properties when used as isolated scales. Results We identified 5.8 different levels of performance. Discriminant functions obtained from sample data indicated that the scale's main factors correctly classified 98.4\% of the cases. The main factors: Internal symptom factor (ISF) and external symptom factor (ESF) showed good measurement properties and can be considered as subscales. Conclusion CVSS17 scores defined five different levels of performance. In addition, two main factors (ESF and ISF) were identified and these confirmed by discriminant analysis. These subscales served to assess either the visual or the ocular symptoms attributable to computer use.},

  abstract = {Exploratory factor analysis is a statistical method commonly used in psychological research to investigate latent variables and to develop questionnaires. Although such selfreport questionnaires are prone to missing values, there is not much literature on this topic with regard to exploratory factor analysis---and especially the process of factor retention. Determining the correct number of factors is crucial for the analysis, yet little is known about how to deal with missingness in this process. Therefore, in a simulation study, six missing data methods (an expectation--maximization algorithm, predictive mean matching, Bayesian regression, random forest imputation, complete case analysis, and pairwise complete observations) were compared with respect to the accuracy of the parallel analysis chosen as retention criterion. Data were simulated for correlated and uncorrelated factor structures with two, four, or six factors; 12, 24, or 48 variables; 250, 500, or 1,000 observations and three different missing data mechanisms. Two different procedures combining multiply imputed data sets were tested. The results showed that no missing data method was always superior, yet random forest imputation performed best for the majority of conditions---in particular when parallel analysis was applied to the averaged correlation matrix rather than to each imputed data set separately. Complete case analysis and pairwise complete observations were often inferior to multiple imputation.},

People who self-report extreme weather events are willing to pay approximately \$112/year more for climate mitigation policy than those who do not; people for whom those selfreports match recorded data are willing to pay \$106 or \$71 more (controlling for climate beliefs and political ideology and depending on how unverified reporters are treated). Wildfires have the strongest influence on WTP. Though our results show that political ideology correlates more strongly with policy support than does extreme event experience, extreme event experience exhibits a robust correlation with policy support, and could result in a minimum of billions of dollars of support annually for clean-energy policy alone.},

Two Monte Carlo simulation experiments show that multicollinearity can cause problems under certain conditions, specifically: (1) when multicollinearity is extreme, Type II error rates are generally unacceptably high (over 80\%), (2) when multicollinearity is between 0.6 and 0.8, Type II error rates can be substantial (greater than 50\% and frequently above 80\%) if composite reliability is weak, explained variance (R               2               ) is low, and sample size is relatively small. However, as reliability improves (0.80 or higher), explained variance R               2               reaches 0.75, and sample becomes relatively large, Type II error rates become negligible. (3) When multicollinearity is between 0.4 and 0.5, Type II error rates tend to be quite small, except when reliability is weak, R               2               is low, and sample size is small, in which case error rates can still be high (greater than 50\%). Methods for detecting and correcting multicollinearity are briefly discussed. However, since multicollinearity is difficult to manage after the fact, researchers should avoid problems by carefully managing the factors known to mitigate multicollinearity problems (particularly measurement error).},

By adapting and synthesizing aspects of Eagly and Chaiken's Heuristic-Systematic Model and Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior, we also expect that people who engage in more effortful information seeking and processing are more likely to develop risk-related cognitions, attitudes, and behaviors that are more stable (i.e., less changeable or volatile) over time. Since most forms of health information campaigns attempt to get people to adopt habitual or lifestyle changes, factors leading to the stability or volatility of those behavioral changes are essential concerns.},

Here we study the effect of such combinations. We apply construal level theory to classify different intervention approaches, which can either be at a high construal level (abstract and distant) or at a low construal level (concrete and proximal). In a field experiment we recruited 197 students living in one-person apartments in an all-inclusive student housing facility. We objectively measured their individual electricity and warm water use, and measured psychological variables through surveys. We expected that the (commonly considered superior) combination between a high and a low construal level approach would be least effective. Participants were randomly assigned to a 2(Construal Level: low vs. high) {\texttimes} 2(Social Distance: low vs. high) plus control condition mixed-model design targeting a reduction in warm water use. Our findings suggest that a congruent combination at a high construal level (i.e., the high construal level condition combined with the high social distance condition) has the largest effect on warm water use and that spillover to electricity use is most likely to occur when a high construal level is used (i.e., high social distance). Moreover, especially participants who valued nature and the environment less were most strongly influenced by the combination of two high construal level approaches. In sum, our study suggests that when designing interventions one should consider the construal level and when targeting pro-environmental behavior high construal levels appear most appropriate.},

Deaths are concentrated in the eastern quadrant of the United States and are most common during August. Over half the deaths occurred during morning practices when high humidity levels were common. The athletes were typically large (79\% with a body mass index {$>$}30) and mostly (86\%) played linemen positions. Meteorological conditions were atypically hot and humid by local standards on most days with fatalities. Further, all deaths occurred under conditions defined as high or extreme by the American College of Sports Medicine using the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), but under lower threat levels using the heat index (HI). Football-specific thresholds based on clothing (full football uniform, practice uniform, or shorts) were also examined. The thresholds matched well with data from athletes wearing practice uniforms but poorly for those in shorts only. Too few cases of athletes in full pads were available to draw any broad conclusions. We recommend that coaches carefully monitor players, particularly large linemen, early in the pre-season on days with wet bulb globe temperatures that are categorized as high or extreme. Also, as most of the deaths were among young athletes, longer acclimatization periods may be needed.},

  abstract = {After a decades-long economic slump, the city of Flint, Michigan, struggled to address chronic issues of toxic water supply, malnutrition, and food security gaps among its residents. A community-engaged research project proposed a resilience assessment that would use panarchy theory to move the city toward a more sustainable food system. Flint is one of many examples that demonstrates how panarchy theory is being applied to understand and influence change in complex human-natural systems. Applied Panarchy, the much-anticipated successor to Lance Gunderson and C.S. Holling's seminal 2002 volume Panarchy, documents the extraordinary advances in interdisciplinary panarchy scholarship and applications over the past two decades. Panarchy theory has been applied to a broad range of fields, from economics to law to urban planning, changing the practice of environmental stewardship for the better in measurable, tangible ways.  Panarchy describes the way systems---whether forests, electrical grids, agriculture, coastal surges, public health, or human economies and governance---are part of even larger systems that interact in unpredictable ways. Although humans desire resiliency and stability in our lives to help us understand the world and survive, nothing in nature is permanently stable. How can society anticipate and adjust to the changes we see around us? Where Panarchy proposed a framework to understand how these transformational cycles work and how we might influence them, Applied Panarchy takes the scholarship to the next level, demonstrating how these concepts have been modified and refined. The book shows how panarchy theory intersects with other disciplines, and how it directly influences natural resources management and environmental stewardship.  Intended as a text for graduate courses in environmental sciences and related fields, Applied Panarchy picks up where Panarchy left off, inspiring new generations of scholars, researchers, and professionals to put its ideas to work in practical ways.},

In the study, data obtained from 379 university students were used for the development of a 46-item scale. As the first item removal strategy, crossloading items on two factors and where the difference between factor loadings was less than .10 were identified. Then, items were removed one by one, starting with the item with the least difference between the loadings on the factors. As the second strategy, the items that loaded on two factors and where the difference between factor loadings was less than .10 were found, and these items were removed from the scale as a whole. As the third strategy, the items that gave high loading on more than two factors and where the difference between these factors was less than .10 were identified. The item removal process was started with these items. The study results show that the factor numbers obtained using three different strategies during the item removal process of EFA were the same; however, the number of items on the scale, the explained variance ratio, and the total scale, and reliability values differed. Furthermore, the items in the factors were not all the same. The study results underscore the importance of theoretical competence in the scale development process.},

  abstract = {In response to agriculture's vulnerability and contribution to climate change, many governments are developing initiatives that promote the adoption of mitigation and adaptation practices among farmers. Since most climate policies affecting agriculture rely on voluntary efforts by individual farmers, success requires a sound understanding of the factors that motivate farmers to change practices. Recent evidence suggests that past experience with the effects of climate change and the psychological distance associated with people's concern for global and local impacts can influence environmental behavior. Here we surveyed farmers in a representative rural county in California's Central Valley to examine how their intention to adopt mitigation and adaptation practices is influenced by previous climate experiences and their global and local concerns about climate change. Perceived changes in water availability had significant effects on farmers' intention to adopt mitigation and adaptation strategies, which were mediated through global and local concerns respectively. This suggests that mitigation is largely motivated by psychologically distant concerns and beliefs about climate change, while adaptation is driven by psychologically proximate concerns for local impacts. This match between attitudes and behaviors according to the psychological distance at which they are cognitively construed indicates that policy and outreach initiatives may benefit by framing climate impacts and behavioral goals concordantly; either in a global context for mitigation or a local context for adaptation.},

In combination with technical advances in agriculture, dietary change is suggested to be necessary to reduce the environmental impact of the food system.

The aims are to i) evaluate the scientific basis of dietary scenario analysis, ii) estimate the potential environmental effects of dietary change, iii) identify methodological aspects of importance for outcome and iv) identify current gaps in knowledge. The review includes 14 peer-reviewed journal articles assessing the GHG emissions and land use demand of in total 49 dietary scenarios. The results suggest that dietary change, in areas with affluent diet, could play an important role in reaching environmental goals, with up to 50\% potential to reduce GHG emissions and land use demand associated with the current diet. The choice of functional unit, system boundaries and methods for scenario development and accounting for uncertainties are methodological aspects identified to have major influence on the quality and results of dietary scenario analysis. Further understanding of dietary change as a measure for more sustainable food systems requires improved knowledge of uncertainty in dietary scenario studies, environmental impact from substitutes and complements to meat and the effect of dietary change in different groups of populations and geographical locations.},

The second edition, like the first, is intended to serve as a didactically-oriented resource for graduate students and research professionals, covering a broad range of advanced topics often not discussed in introductory courses on structural equation modeling (SEM). Such topics are important in furthering the understanding of foundations and assumptions underlying SEM as well as in exploring SEM, as a potential tool to address new types of research questions that might not have arisen during a first course. Chapters focus on the clear explanation and application of topics, rather than on analytical derivations, and contain materials from popular SEM software. "This book represents a significant updating and expansion of Hancock and Mueller's excellent first edition that explores a variety of topics not typically covered in introductory SEM courses. The second edition is again characterized by the substantial strengths of the original text including a clearly articulated didactic presentation style and a cohesive voice that connects each chapter to the next. This revised edition not only incorporates comprehensive updates to the original material but also includes the addition of a number of wholly new chapters covering important and contemporary topics including partial least squares estimation, conditional process modeling, exploratory SEM, and Bayesian estimation. Taken together, this is an indispensable resource for both beginner and advanced users of SEM across the social and behavioral sciences; I recommend it highly." -- Patrick J.

Equilibrium sensitivity, including slower surface albedo feedbacks, is {\textasciitilde}6 deg-C for doubled CO2 for the range of climate states between glacial conditions and ice-free Antarctica. Decreasing CO2 was the main cause of a cooling trend that began 50 million years ago, large scale glaciation occurring when CO2 fell to 450 +/- 100 ppm, a level that will be exceeded within decades, barring prompt policy changes. If humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted, paleoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO2 will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at most 350 ppm. The largest uncertainty in the target arises from possible changes of non-CO2 forcings. An initial 350 ppm CO2 target may be achievable by phasing out coal use except where CO2 is captured and adopting agricultural and forestry practices that sequester carbon. If the present overshoot of this target CO2 is not brief, there is a possibility of seeding irreversible catastrophic effects.},

The distribution of seasonal mean temperature anomalies has shifted toward higher temperatures and the range of anomalies has increased. An important change is the emergence of a category of summertime extremely hot outliers, more than three standard deviations (3{$\sigma$}) warmer than the climatology of the 1951--1980 base period. This hot extreme, which covered much less than 1\% of Earth's surface during the base period, now typically covers about 10\% of the land area. It follows that we can state, with a high degree of confidence, that extreme anomalies such as those in Texas and Oklahoma in 2011 and Moscow in 2010 were a consequence of global warming because their likelihood in the absence of global warming was exceedingly small. We discuss practical implications of this substantial, growing, climate change.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) is increasingly performed in health sciences. PRO differs from other measurements because such patient characteristics cannot be directly observed. Item response theory (IRT) is an attractive way for PRO analysis. However, in the framework of IRT, sample size justification is rarely provided or ignores the fact that PRO measures are latent variables with the use of formulas developed for observed variables. It might therefore be inappropriate and might provide inadequately sized studies. The objective was to develop valid sample size methodology for the comparison of PRO in two groups of patients using IRT. The proposed approach takes into account questionnaire's items parameters, the difference of the latent variables means, and its variance whose derivation is approximated using Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). We also computed the associated power. We realized a simulation study taking into account sample size, number of items, and value of the group effect. We compared power obtained from CRB with the one obtained from simulations (SIM) and with the power based on observed variables (OBS). For a given sample size, powers using CRB and SIM were similar and always lower than OBS. We observed a strong impact of the number of items for CRB and SIM, the power increasing with the questionnaire's length but not for OBS. In the context of latent variables, it seems important to use an adapted sample size formula because the formula developed for observed variables seems to be inadequate and leads to an underestimated study size. {\copyright} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We show in an extensive simulation study that our method slightly outperforms existing methods, including parallel analysis, Bayesian information criterion (BIC), Akaike information criterion (AIC), root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), and exploratory graph analysis. In addition, we show that, among the best performing methods, our method is the one that is most robust across different specifications of the true factor model.

  abstract = {Researchers frequently wish to make incremental validity claims, suggesting that a construct of interest significantly predicts a given outcome when controlling for other overlapping constructs and potential confounders. Once the significance of such an effect has been established, it is good practice to also assess and report its magnitude. In OLS regression, this is easily accomplished by calculating the change in R-squared, {$\Delta$}R2, between one's full model and a reduced model that omits all but the target predictor(s) of interest. Because observed variable regression methods ignore measurement error, however, their estimates are prone to bias and inflated type I error rates. As a result, researchers are increasingly encouraged to switch from observed variable modeling conducted in the regression framework to latent variable modeling conducted in the structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. Standard SEM software packages provide overall R2 measures for each outcome, yet calculation of {$\Delta$}R2 is not intuitive in models with latent variables. Omitting all indicators of a latent factor in a reduced model will alter the overidentifying constraints imposed on the model, affecting parameter estimation and fit. Furthermore, omitting variables in a reduced model may affect estimation under missing data, particularly when conditioning on those variables is essential to meeting the MAR assumption. In this article, I describe four approaches to calculating {$\Delta$}R2 in SEMs with latent variables and missing data, compare their performance via simulation, describe a set of extensions to the methods, and provide a set of R functions for calculating {$\Delta$}R2 in SEM.},

Will this barrier weaken when publics experience climate impacts first-hand, making the short-term costs of inaction more salient? Using a natural experiment based on the timing of Californian wildfires, we evaluate, for the first time, how exposure to a climate-related hazard influences political behavior, rather than self-reported attitudes or behavioral intentions. We show that wildfires increased support for costly, pro-climate ballot measures by 4 to 6 percentage points for those living within 15km of a recent wildfire. The effect drops by approximately 1.7 percentage points for every 10km thereafter. This effect is largest in Democratic-voting areas, and nearly zero in Republican-dominated areas. We conclude that experienced climate threats can enhance willingness-to-act, but predominately where the public already holds pro-climate beliefs.},

Risk cognition and adaptation cognition have significantly positive influences on climate change adaptive behavior, and loss aversion has a significantly positive influence on farmers{$\prime$} adaptation decisions. Loss aversion exerts a positive impact on risk cognition and adaptation cognition, and risk aversion has a positive impact on adaptation cognition.

However, considering that actors also care about the outcomes for others (i.e. they hold other-regarding preferences), PEB may also be encouraged by addressing these other-regarding preferences. In this paper, we review the results from social science experiments where interventions addressing other-regarding preferences were used to promote PEB. Based on our synthesis, we conclude that addressing other-regarding preferences can be effective in promoting (various types of) PEB in some, but not in all instances. Whether an intervention was effective depended inter alia on the pre-established preferences, cost structures and the perceived cooperation of others. Effective interventions included the provision of information on behavioural consequences, perspective-taking, direct appeals, framing and re-categorization. The interventions worked by activating other-regarding preferences, raising awareness about adverse consequences, evoking empathic concern and expanding the moral circle. We propose to take these findings as an impulse to examine policy instruments and institutions in terms of whether they activate and strengthen other-regarding preferences, thereby enabling collective engagement in PEB.},

Although the emergency eventually turned out to be a false alarm, various witnesses showed pronounced distress owing to a vast police operation. The GFP structure was replicated using two alternative modelling approaches. Neuroticism related substantially to acute fear and traumatic distress as well as to more enduring maladaptive coping. Agreeableness was negatively associated with the coping strategy of medication use, whereas both agreeableness and conscientiousness related positively to social activity following the emergency. The GFP related moderately to peri-traumatic distress and showed a substantial negative association with medication use and a strong positive association with social activity. In conclusion, both the GFP and Big Five traits significantly moderate stress responses following a stressful life event. The GFP predominantly relates to socially adaptive coping, whereas in particular neuroticism accounts for acute stress reactions such as fear and traumatic distress. These findings support the notion that personality influences how persons react in the face of adversity. Copyright {\copyright} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This study compared the impact of heat waves on health outcomes among different heat wave definitions based on thermal comfort and air temperature. We compared heat waves in South Korea (cities and provinces) for the warm season for 2011--2014, using air temperature, heat index (HI), and web-bulb globe temperature (WBGT). Heat waves were defined as days with daily maximum values of each index at a specified threshold (literature-based, the 90th and 95th percentiles) or above. Distributed lag non-linear models and meta-analysis were used to estimate risk of mortality and hospitalization for all-causes, cardiovascular causes, respiratory causes and heat disorders during heat wave days compared to non-heat wave days. WBGT identified 1.15 times longer maximum heat wave duration for the study periods than air temperature when the thresholds were based on 90th and 95th percentiles. Over the study period, for heat waves defined by WBGT and HI, the Southwestern region showed the highest total number of heat wave days, whereas for air temperature the longest heat wave days were identified in the southeastern region. The highest and most significant impact of heat waves were found by WBGT for hospitalization from heat disorders (Relative risk = 2.959, 95\% CI: 1.566--5.594). In sensitivity analyses using different structure of lags and temperature metrics (e.g., daily mean and minimum), the impacts of heat waves on most health outcomes substantially increased by using WBGT for heat wave definitions. As a result, WBGT and its thresholds can be used to relate heat waves and heat-related diseases to improve the prevention effectiveness of heat wave warnings and give informative health guidelines according to the range of WBGT thresholds.},

We use Google search intensity data as a proxy for the salience of climate change and examine how search patterns vary with unusual local weather. We find that searches for ``climate change'' and ``global warming'' increase with extreme temperatures and unusual lack of snow. Furthermore, we demonstrate that effects of abnormal weather extend beyond search behavior to observable action on environmental issues. We examine the voting records of members of the U.S. Congress from 2004 to 2011 and find that members are more likely to take a pro-environment stance on votes when their home state experiences unusual weather.},

  abstract = {A crucial point regarding the development and calibration of an aptitude test is the presence of missing values. In most test administrations, examinees omit individual items even in high-stakes tests. The most common procedure for treating these missing values in data analysis is to score these responses as incorrect; however, an alternative would be to consider omitted responses as if they were not administered to the examinee in question. Previous research has found that both procedures for dealing with missing values result in bias in item and person parameter estimation. Regarding test construction, not only is there an interest in item parameter estimation, but also in global and item-specific model tests as well as goodness-of-fit indices. On the basis of such statistics , it will be decided which items constitute the final item pool of a test. The present study therefore investigates the influence of two different procedures for dealing with missing values on model and item-specific tests as well as item fit indices for the Rasch model. The impact of these different treatment alternatives is shown for an empirical example and, furthermore, for simulated data. Simulations reveal that the global model test, as well as the item test, is affected by the procedures used to deal with missing values. To summarize, the results indicate that scoring omitted items as incorrect leads to seriously biased results.},

Methods A cross-sectional multisite study of youths (N = 222) with T1D (mean age = 12.6) used structural equation modeling to examine interrelations among predictors, with follow-up analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs). Results Youths' memory skills related to diabetes knowledge which, along with self-efficacy and age, was associated with greater youth responsibility that in turn predicted poorer self-care behaviors. Less frequent/briefer exercise and less frequent blood glucose monitoring/eating were found; the latter directly related to poorer metabolic control. Behavior problems also were associated directly with poorer metabolic control. A parsimonious model found memory directly related to blood glucose testing. Conclusions Continued parental supervision of adolescents, along with monitoring diabetes knowledge and efficacy, may help optimize transfer of diabetes care from parents to youths. Behavior problems warrant immediate attention because of their direct and adverse relation to metabolic control.},

  abstract = {For over 50 years, scientists have sounded alarms that the burning of fossil fuels is causing changes to the Earth's climate, and that failure to take action on climate change will have devastating consequences. Despite this urgency, CO2 emissions (and global temperatures) continue to climb. Progress on mitigating climate change is slowed by the stubborn persistence of climate skepticism, as well as a failure for nonskeptics to translate their concern about climate change into meaningful action. The goal of this article is to describe and synthesize research on how to understand (and reduce) this public inaction on climate change. In the first half of the article, we examine the question of how to understand (and overcome) climate change skepticism. We review international evidence regarding the role of demographics, ideologies, and conspiracist worldviews in shaping people's willingness to believe in the reality of human-caused climate change. We then review theory and research on how to successfully capture the attention of---and change the behavior of---people who traditionally resist climate change messages, such as those high in conservatism and free-market beliefs. In the second half of the article, we examine how to promote more climate-friendly behaviors among people who believe in the reality of climate change. Evidence will be reviewed suggesting that many people agree that climate change is caused by humans, but are not yet willing to make the necessary investments and sacrifices to respond to this threat. We then draw on relevant literatures to critically discuss three strategies for promoting proenvironmental behavior: (i) optimistic versus pessimistic messages; (ii) in-group versus out-group messenger effects; and (c) the use of descriptive and injunctive norms.},

We further examine whether perceptions of changes in local climates are influenced by prior beliefs about global warming, through the process of motivated reasoning. Using national survey data collected in the United States in 2011, we find that subjective experiences of seasonal average temperature and precipitation during the previous winter and summer were related to recorded conditions during each season. Beliefs about global warming also had significant effects on subjective experiences with above-normal temperatures, particularly among those who believed that global warming is not happening. When asked about the summer of 2010, those who believed that global warming is not happening were significantly less likely to report that they had experienced a warmer-than-normal summer, even when controlling for demographics and local climate conditions. These results suggest that the subjective experience of local climate change is dependent not only on external climate conditions, but also on individual beliefs, with perceptions apparently biased by prior beliefs about global warming.},

We overlay geocoded survey responses indicating personal experience with hurricanes, tornadoes, and drought---from a 2012 nationally representative survey (N\,=\,1,008) of U.S. residents---on maps of recorded event impacts. We find that reported experiences correspond well with recorded event impacts, particularly for hurricanes and tornadoes. Reported experiences were related to event type, proximity, magnitude and duration.

How will individual experiences with these weather trends shape climate change beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors? In this article, we review 73 papers that have studied the relationship between climate change experiences and public opinion. Overall, we find mixed evidence that weather shapes climate opinions. Although there is some support for a weak effect of local temperature and extreme weather events on climate opinion, the heterogeneity of independent variables, dependent variables, study populations, and research designs complicate systematic comparison. To advance research on this critical topic, we suggest that future studies pay careful attention to differences between self-reported and objective weather data, causal identification, and the presence of spatial autocorrelation in weather and climate data. Refining research designs and methods in future studies will help us understand the discrepancies in results, and allow better detection of effects, which have important practical implications for climate communication. As the global population increasingly experiences weather conditions outside the range of historical experience, researchers, communicators, and policymakers need to understand how these experiences shape-and are shaped by-public opinions and behaviors.},

Under hurricane conditions, a parameter called the radius of maximum wind, R, is needed for deep water wave generation. Although literature states that the typical value of R is either 40 or 50 km, it has not been quantified. This brief note is to provide the R values as a function of the Saffir/Simpson hurricane classification. On the basis of 59 hurricanes from 1893 through 1979 affecting the U.S. coastline as compiled by Simpson and Riehl, 90\% fall between categories 2 and 4 having a composite mean R = 48 km with a standard deviation of only 3 km. Since only 8\% and 2\% sample remain for Categories 1 and 5, respectively, the statistical results are not recommended; however use of the generic formula to obtain R should be employed. The composite mean of 47 km for all hurricanes as compiled with central pressures between 909 and 993 mb is obtained, which quantifies the literature value.},

Using a 2-index presentation strategy, which includes using the maximum likelihood (ML)-based standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) and supplementing it with either Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), Bollen's (1989) Fit Index (BL89), Relative Noncentrality Index (RNI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Gamma Hat, McDonald's Centrality Index (Mc), or root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), various combinations of cutoff values from selected ranges of cutoff criteria for the ML-based SRMR and a given supplemental fit index were used to calculate rejection rates for various types of true-population and misspecified models; that is, models with misspecified factor covariance(s) and models with misspecified factor loading(s). The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the 2-index presentation strategy is required to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true-population and misspecified models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the ML-based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true-population models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when sample size is small.},

Our results show no association between recent experiences of elevated temperature relative to long-term average and views about climate change, though some association between longer-term temperature experiences. We find some evidence that experiencing less rainfall relative to the historical average is related to stronger sentiment that climate change is happening and higher levels of concern.

We contend that recall of actual climatic events consists of two components: fact and partisan distortion. When asked about their experience with wildfire, Republicans are less likely than Democrats to recall experiencing smoke and wildfires. The difference is partly attributable to partisan distortion that is rooted in differential beliefs about global climate change. Proximity to wildfires and exposure to dense wildfire smoke diminish partisan distortions in recalling personal experiences with wildfires. Proximity to wildfires also increases Republican support for wildfire adaptive policies that involve public funding, a core issue that typically divides Democrats and Republicans. As global climate change induces more frequent and intense climatic events, the frequency of objectively personal experiences with extreme weather related events like wildfires may help to reduce partisan gaps over climate policy.},

Consumers, however, are unlikely to break their food habits unless they are aware of the problem and motivated by the solutions. Fear appeals are often used to overcome this, however, their effectiveness in the context of meat reduction and climate change is unclear. Given the widespread use of fear appeals in information policy, it is important to understand more. The aim of this study was to explore fear---or more specifically---the danger control process in a climate change---food context in order to understand the factors which motivate consumers to reduce or alter their meat consumption. Using a stratified random sample of 222 respondents in Southern Sweden, we develop a model for predicting intentions to adopt specific and general actions to reduce or alter meat consumption. Our results suggest that the general key to motivating consumers is through increasing their self-efficacy towards adopting meat alternatives and educating them on the importance their actions have in reducing the threat. We also found that appraising the threat to self (or those close) was significant, but surprisingly the effect size was greater when the threat concerned others (e.g. others in impoverished nations, animals).},

A cross-sectional survey of 205 US adults recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk assessed participants' climate change knowledge, efficacy for climate change, and attitude to mitigation. Indirect effects of self-efficacy for climate change were observed in three mediation models, suggesting efficacy for climate change explains some of the relationship between specific climate change knowledge and attitude to mitigation.

Our results show that 57\% of structures (homes, schools, hospitals, office buildings, etc.) are located in hazard hotspots, which represent only a third of CONUS area, and {$\sim$}1.5 million buildings lie in hotspots for two or more hazards. These critical levels of exposure are the legacy of decades of sustained growth and point to our inability, lack of knowledge, or unwillingness to limit development in hazardous zones. Development in these areas is still growing more rapidly than the baseline rates for the nation, portending larger future losses even if the effects of climate change are not considered.},

Using the new EXIOBASE 2.2 multiregional input-output database, which describes the world economy at the detail of 43 countries, five rest-of-the-world regions, and 200 product sectors, we are able to trace the origin of the products consumed by households and represent global supply chains for 2007. We highlight the importance of environmental pressure arising from households with their consumption contributing to more than 60\% of global GHG emissions and between 50\% and 80\% of total land, material, and water use. The footprints are unevenly distributed across regions, with wealthier countries generating the most significant impacts per capita. Elasticities suggest a robust and significant relationship between households' expenditure and their environmental impacts, driven by a rising demand of nonprimary consumption items. Mobility, shelter, and food are the most important consumption categories across the environmental footprints. Globally, food accounts for 48\% and 70\% of household impacts on land and water resources, respectively, with consumption of meat, dairy, and processed food rising fast with income. Shelter and mobility stand out with high carbon and material intensity, whereas the significance of services for footprints relates to the large amount of household expenditure associated with them.},

However, little empirical evidence is available to support the alleged superiority of IRT in the context of individual change assessment. In this study, the authors compared the CTT and IRT methods with respect to their Type I error and detection rates. Preliminary results revealed that IRT is indeed superior to CTT in individual change detection, provided that the tests consist of at least 20 items.

Examples are the use of student evaluations to measure teaching quality, or the use of employee ratings of organizational climate. In earlier research, Stapleton and Johnson (2019) provided advice for measuring cluster-level constructs based on a simulation study with inadvertently confounded design factors. We extended their simulation study using both Mplus and lavaan to reveal how their conclusions were dependent on their study conditions. Methods: We generated data sets from the so-called configural model and the simultaneous shared-and-configural model, both with and without nonzero residual variances at the cluster level. We fitted models to these data sets using different maximum likelihood estimation algorithms. Results: Stapleton and Johnson's results were highly contingent on their confounded design factors. Convergence rates could be very different across algorithms, depending on whether between-level residual variances were zero in the population or in the fitted model. We discovered a worrying convergence issue with the default settings in Mplus, resulting in seemingly converged solutions that are actually not. Rejection rates of the normal-theory test statistic were as expected, while rejection rates of the scaled test statistic were seriously inflated in several conditions. Conclusions: The defaults in Mplus carry specific risks that are easily checked but not well advertised. Our results also shine a different light on earlier advice on the use of measurement models for shared factors.},

Encompassing European Union (EU) countries, the objective of this paper was to analyse how economic development and Hofstede's cultural dimensions contributed to climate change concerns, personal responsibility, and actions related to climate change mitigation. Furthermore, considering that actions related to climate change mitigation have different costs and benefits, in this study, we aimed to reveal whether climate change concerns and personal responsibility equally influenced all actions related to climate change mitigation and whether all types of actions were guided by the same goals. The results showed that the performance of actions related to climate change mitigation varied across European countries. The largest share of respondents declared that they reduce waste and regularly separate it for recycling. Meanwhile, a smaller share of people noted that they perform very high-cost actions such as the purchase of low-energy homes and electric cars. Economic development level significantly affects the assumption of personal responsibility and the number of actions related to climate change mitigation but not climate change concerns. Hofstede's cultural dimensions influence climate change concerns, responsibility, and the number of actions differently. Considering separate actions related to climate change mitigation, the assumption of personal responsibility significantly and positively influenced almost all actions. Climate change concerns positively and significantly affected only low-cost actions. Because of the different costs and guiding goals, the respondents who performed one action did not necessarily perform other actions related to climate change mitigation.},

An online survey of 219 US citizens assessed tolerance of ambiguity, political orientation, and beliefs about climate change. Results indicated that low tolerance of ambiguity predicted beliefs that: 1) climate change is not a problem; 2) is not the result of human activity, and; 3) cannot be corrected through individual behavior. Analyses also supported that these relationships were mediated by conservative political orientation. The link between conservative politics and refusal to accept climate science may reflect a proximate relationship; personality characteristics, like tolerance of ambiguity, may ultimately be responsible for drawing people to both political and environmental ideologies.},

But this does not mean that people and their politics are irrational. Bounded rationality asserts that decision makers are intendedly rational; that is, they are goal-oriented and adaptive, but because of human cognitive and emotional architecture, they sometimes fail, occasionally in important decisions. Limits on rational adaptation are of two types: procedural limits, which limit how we go about making decisions, and substantive limits, which affect particular choices directly. Rational analysis in institutional contexts can serve as a standard for adaptive, goal-oriented human behavior. In relatively fixed task environments, such as asset markets or elections, we should be able to divide behavior into adaptive, goal-oriented behavior (that is, rational action) and behavior that is a consequence of processing limits, and we should then be able to measure the deviation. The extent of deviation is an empirical issue. These classes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, and they may be examined empirically in situations in which actors make repeated similar choices.},

In this study, we employed construal level theory to investigate whether a climate change communication intervention could increase public engagement by reducing the psychological distance of climate change. Australian residents (N = 333) were randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: one framed to increase psychological distance to climate change (distal frame), and the other framed to reduce psychological distance (proximal frame). Participants then completed measures of psychological distance of climate change impacts, climate change concern, and intentions to engage in mitigation behavior. Principal components analysis indicated that psychological distance to climate change was best conceptualized as a multidimensional construct consisting of four components: geographic, temporal, social, and uncertainty. Path analysis revealed the effect of the treatment frame on climate change concern and intentions was fully mediated by psychological distance dimensions related to uncertainty and social distance. Our results suggest that climate communications framed to reduce psychological distance represent a promising strategy for increasing public engagement with climate change.},

  abstract = {In multigroup factor analysis, different levels of measurement invariance are accepted as tenable when researchers observe a nonsignificant (⌬)␹2 test after imposing certain equality constraints across groups. Large samples yield high power to detect negligible misspecifications, so many researchers prefer alternative fit indices (AFIs). Fixed cutoffs have been proposed for evaluating the effect of invariance constraints on change in AFIs (e.g., Chen, 2007; Cheung \& Rensvold, 2002; Meade, Johnson, \& Braddy, 2008). We demonstrate that all of these cutoffs have inconsistent Type I error rates. As a solution, we propose replacing ␹2 and fixed AFI cutoffs with permutation tests. Randomly permuting group assignment results in average between-groups differences of zero, so iterative permutation yields an empirical distribution of any fit measure under the null hypothesis of invariance across groups. Our simulations show that the permutation test of configural invariance controls Type I error rates better than ␹2 or AFIs when the model contains parsimony error (i.e., negligible misspecification) but the factor structure is equivalent across groups (i.e., the null hypothesis is true). For testing metric and scalar invariance, ⌬␹2 and permutation yield similar power and nominal Type I error rates, whereas ⌬AFIs yield inflated errors in smaller samples. Permuting the maximum modification index among equality constraints control familywise Type I error rates when testing multiple indicators for lack of invariance, but provide similar power as using a Bonferroni adjustment. An applied example and syntax for software are provided.},

A large survey of U.S. adults (N = 1540) found little support for this account. On the whole, the most scientifically literate and numerate subjects were slightly less likely, not more, to see climate change as a serious threat than the least scientifically literate and numerate ones. More importantly, greater scientific literacy and numeracy were associated with greater cultural polarization: Respondents predisposed by their values to dismiss climate change evidence became more dismissive, and those predisposed by their values to credit such evidence more concerned, as science literacy and numeracy increased. We suggest that this evidence reflects a conflict between two levels of rationality: The individual level, which is characterized by citizens' effective use of their knowledge and reasoning capacities to form risk perceptions that express their cultural commitments; and the collective level, which is characterized by citizens' failure to converge on the best available scientific evidence on how to promote their common welfare. Dispelling this, ``tragedy of the risk-perception commons,'' we argue, should be understood as the central aim of the science of science communication.},

Such a measure was developed in a survey study of 445 members of 2 Swiss transportation associations. Three types of ecological behavior measures were included: a general measure, 3 multiple-item measures, and 3 single-item measures. Results are controlled for social desirability effects. Reliability, internal consistency, and validity scores indicate that a probabilistic measurement approach can measure general ecological behavior accurately and unidimensionally.},

The present paper establishes an expanded rational-choice model of environmental attitude that extends into the moral domain by using feelings of personal obligation toward the environment (i. e., feelings of responsibility) as an additional predictor of intentions to behave ecologically. Findings from two studies are presented. In Study 1 a sample of Swiss adults (N-436) was used to. test the proposed model. Study 2 replicates the Keywords: Ecological behavior, environmental attitude, responsibility. findings of Study 1 with a sample of California college students (N = 488). Assessments were carried out in a structural equation modeling framework. Environmental knowledge, environmental values, and responsibility feelings together explained 45\% (50\% in Study 2) of the variance of ecological behavior intention which, in turn, predicted 76\% (94\%) of the explainable variance of general ecological behavior. As the inclusion of responsibility feelings increased the proportion of explained variance of ecological behavior intention by 5\% (10\%) above and beyond a more basic attitude model, the moral extension of the proposed attitude model is largely supported.},

  abstract = {In test analysis involving the Rasch model, a large degree of importance is placed on the "objective" measurement of individual abilities and item difficulties. The degree to which the objectivity properties are attained, of course, depends on the degree to which the data fit the Rasch model. It is therefore important to utilize fit statistics that accurately and reliably detect the person-item response inconsistencies that threaten the measurement objectivity of persons and items. Given this argument, it is somewhat surprising that there is far more emphasis placed in the objective measurement of person and items than there is in the measurement quality of Rasch fit statistics. This paper provides a critical analysis of the residual fit statistics of the Rasch model, arguably the most often used fit statistics, in an effort to illustrate that the task of Rasch fit analysis is not as simple and straightforward as it appears to be. The faulty statistical properties of the residual fit statistics do not allow either a convenient or a straightforward approach to Rasch fit analysis. For instance, given a residual fit statistic, the use of a single minimum critical value for misfit diagnosis across different testing situations, where the situations vary in sample and test properties, leads to both the overdetection and underdetection of misfit. To improve this situation, it is argued that psychometricians need to implement residual-free Rasch fit statistics that are based on the number of Guttman response errors, or use indices that are statistically optimal in detecting measurement disturbances.},

This hypothesis is tested by formalizing an index that measures local changes in climate using station data and comparing this index with survey-based model estimates of county-level opinion about whether global warming is happening. Results indicate that more stations exhibit cooling and warming than predicted by random chance and that spatial variations in these changes can account for spatial variations in the percentage of the population that believes that ``global warming is happening.'' This effect is diminished in areas that have experienced more record low temperatures than record highs since 2005. Together, these results suggest that skepticism about climate change is driven partially by personal experiences; an accurate heuristic for local changes in climate identifies obstacles to communicating ongoing changes in climate to the public and how these communications might be improved.},

The Bland--Altman (BA) plot is an alternative to traditional correlational analyses.

The difference (Test \#1 - Test \#2) is constructed on the vertical axis while the mean ([Test \#1 + Test \#2]/2) is depicted on the horizontal axis. Within this plot, one can detect bias between the mean differences, as well as estimate an agreement interval. If the data points are normally distributed, 95\% of differences will lie between the limits, but smaller sample sizes may be unreliable for estimating larger population parameters.

  abstract = {The use of open source software, which has been constantly evolving since the mid-2000s, has affected every research discipline. Disciplines using geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) data have been heavily affected owing to this evolution of technology. Researchers working on these data sets have begun to use open source software intensively. The analysis and visualization of spatial data with the help of open source software has caused the emergence of new different features, which are cost effective and editable by other users. In this study, eight sample points have been used for the analysis of water quality in the Mamas{\i}n dam in the 2209/A group project of ``Assessment and Modeling with GIS and RS Data of the Land Use Effects on Water Quality of Mamas{\i}n Dam'' supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) under its program to support graduate students. While visualizing spatial features of the points, QGIS Desktop 2.18.0 and Studio programs with open source code have been used. The RStudio program is an open source software that allows the use of the functions of the R programming language. This study is an ideal application for spatial analysis studies with the R programming language. The sample points used in the study were analyzed in the laboratories of Department of Environmental Engineering, Aksaray University. Spatial properties of the analyzed data were examined by coding in the Studio program that is free open source software. In the analysis process, first, the libraries, Leaflet(), Leaflet.extras(), rgdal(), sp(), raster(), and magrittr(), which are used in the study, have been uploaded. With the help of these libraries, the locations of the sample points are transferred to the OpenStreetMap using latitudes and longitudes of the geographic coordinate system as base map. The pH, conductivity, PO4-P, PO4, dissolved oxygen, and temperature information of each sample points are assigned to the variables. These variables are added as a feature for each point. The spatial characteristics of the sample points are visualized using the data variable packages and online maps as the base. After the visualization process is completed, the generated map is presented on the website created via Github.},

Most of the current approaches assume normally distributed latent predictor variables. In this article, we describe a nonlinear structural equation mixture approach that integrates the strength of parametric approaches (specification of the nonlinear functional relationship) and the flexibility of semiparametric structural equation mixture approaches for approximating the nonnormality of latent predictor variables. In a comparative simulation study, the advantages of the proposed mixture procedure over contemporary approaches [Latent Moderated Structural Equations approach (LMS) and the extended unconstrained approach] are shown for varying degrees of skewness of the latent predictor variables. Whereas the conventional approaches show either biased parameter estimates or standard errors of the nonlinear effects, the proposed mixture approach provides unbiased estimates and standard errors. We present an empirical example from educational research. Guidelines for applications of the approaches and limitations are discussed.},

And yet previous studies of the mass public's subjective assessments of the risks of global warming and climate change have not sufficiently examined public informedness, public confidence in climate scientists, and the role of personal efficacy in affecting global warming outcomes. By examining the results of a survey on an original and representative sample of Americans, we find that these three forces---informedness, confidence in scientists, and personal efficacy---are related in interesting and unexpected ways, and exert significant influence on risk assessments of global warming and climate change. In particular, more informed respondents both feel less personally responsible for global warming, and also show less concern for global warming. We also find that confidence in scientists has unexpected effects: respondents with high confidence in scientists feel less responsible for global warming, and also show less concern for global warming. These results have substantial implications for the interaction between scientists and the public in general, and for the public discussion of global warming and climate change in particular.},

Unfortunately, most previous work on the RMSEA and its confidence interval has focused on models with a large df. Building on the work of Chen et al. to examine the impact of small df on the RMSEA, we conducted a theoretical analysis and a Monte Carlo simulation using correctly specified models with varying df and sample size. The results of our investigation indicate that when the cutoff values are used to assess the fit of the properly specified models with small df and small sample size, the RMSEA too often falsely indicates a poor fitting model. We recommend not computing the RMSEA for small df models, especially those with small sample sizes, but rather estimating parameters that were not originally specified in the model.},

  abstract = {Background: A deeper understanding of how heat wave definition affects the relationship between heat exposure and health, especially as a function of rurality, will be useful in developing effective heat wave warning systems. Objective: We compared the relationships between different heat wave index (HI) definitions and preterm birth (PTB) and nonaccidental death (NAD) across urban and rural areas. Methods: We used a time-stratified case-crossover design to estimate associations of PTB and NAD with heat wave days (defined using 15 HIs) relative to non--heat wave control days in Alabama, USA (1990--2010). ZIP code--level HIs were derived using data from the North American Land Data Assimilation System. Associations with heat wave days defined using different HIs were compared by bootstrapping. We also examined interactions with rurality. Results: Associations varied depending on the HI used to define heat wave days. Heat waves defined as having at least 2 consecutive days with mean daily temperatures above the 98th percentile were associated with 32.4\% (95\% CI: 3.7, 69.1\%) higher PTB, and heat waves defined as at least 2 consecutive days with mean daily temperatures above the 90th percentile were associated with 3.7\% (95\% CI: 1.1, 6.3\%) higher NAD. Results suggest that significant positive associations were more common when relative---compared with absolute---HIs were used to define exposure. Both positive and negative associations were found in each rurality stratum. However, all stratum-specific significant associations were positive, and NAD associations with heat waves were consistently positive in urban strata but not in middle or rural strata. Conclusions: Based on our findings, we conclude that a relative mean-temperature-only heat wave definition may be the most effective metric for heat wave warning systems in Alabama.

The five FPC methods described are distinguished from each other by how many times they update the prior ability distribution and by how many EM cycles they use. Specifically, the five FPC methods included no prior weights updating and one EM cycle (NWU-OEM) or multiple EM cycles (NWU-MEM), one prior weights updating and one EM cycle (OWU-OEM) or multiple EM cycles (OWU-MEM), and multiple weights updating and multiple EM cycles (MWU-MEM) methods. All the five FPC methods were evaluated in terms of recovery of the underlying ability distribution and item parameters. An important factor in the simulation was three different ability (normal) distributions---N(0, 1), N(0.5, 1.22), and N(1, 1.42)---for FPC groups, with the fixed item parameters obtained with a reference N(0, 1) group. Only the MWU-MEM method appeared to perform properly under all the three distributions. Under the N(0, 1) distribution, the NWU-MEM and OWU-MEM methods also appeared to perform properly. Under the N(0.5, 1.22), and N(1, 1.42) distributions, however, the four methods other than the MWU-MEM method resulted in some or severe under-estimation in the recovery.},

  abstract = {Abstract The extended best-track (EBT) dataset combines the information contained in the tropical cyclone best-track dataset with measurements of tropical cyclone ``size parameters.'' These parameters include the radii of the eye (REYE), maximum winds (RMW), gale-force winds (or size; 17.5 m s-1; R17), damaging-force winds (25.7 m s-1; R26), hurricane-force winds (32.9 m s-1; R33), and the outermost closed isobar (ROCI). The latest update of this dataset, to be used in this study for a size parameter climatology, contains the size parameters for North Atlantic tropical cyclones from 1988 to 2002. Such a climatology has not yet been established in this basin. Most of the results of this North Atlantic study agree with documented tropical cyclone theory and results from similar studies of northwest Pacific tropical cyclones. This provides confidence that the observations of the size parameters in the dataset are reliable. Furthermore, data west and east of 55{$^\circ$}W (the boundary beyond which no aircraft observations are made) are compared. Some differences occur in some of the size parameters, but the sample west of 55{$^\circ$}W is significantly larger and displays a greater spread. This provides confidence that the total dataset may not be affected by the nonaircraft data east of 55{$^\circ$}W. The spatial and temporal distribution of the size parameters is investigated. The radii of gale-force (R17), damaging-force (R26), and hurricane-force (R33) winds tend to increase as storms move poleward and westward. North of 40{$^\circ$}N, R33 and R26 decrease, while R17 increases. This is a reflection of storm weakening after recurvature. Gulf of Mexico storms have larger ROCIs but smaller eyes, R33s, R26s, and R17s than North Atlantic storms between 50{$^\circ$} and 80{$^\circ$}W. Gulf systems tend to form in the gulf instead of moving into this area from the Atlantic. Gulf incipient systems are likely to be tropical upper-tropospheric trough (TUTT) cells or monsoon trough features from the eastern Pacific instead of easterly waves from Africa. Early-season storms tend to be small; late-season storms are larger; and storm size peaks in September. Weakening storms tend to have smaller eyes than intensifying storms; most weakening storms are intense systems that have reached the end of their intensification and eyewall contraction process. These highly organized systems take a long time to spin down. Weak systems with large eyes take a long time to get organized and require a long time to intensify. Knowledge of the areal extent of damaging winds will provide forecasters and emergency managers with additional information to assess the damage potential of approaching storms.},

Rex is a scholar of SEM and has a special gift---of being able to communicate complex statistical concepts in language that all readers can grasp. The accessible style of writing and the many pedagogical features of the book (e.g., chapter-end annotated reading lists, exercises with answers) make it a "must have" for any user of SEM. It is a resource that keeps improving and expanding with each new edition and is the resource I recommend first on this subject---whether the question comes from a beginner or an experienced user. As a scholar of modern statistical practice and techniques. Rex has studied the developments and advances in the world of SEM generally, and he has covered "hot" topics, such as Pearl's structural causal modeling. His coverage of Pearl's graph theory approach to causal reasoning, as many of the reviewers of prepublication drafts of the fourth edition have also noted, is both easy to understand and comprehensive. It's so good, he ought to get a prize for best in presentation! In this new edition, he takes us through causal mediation analysis, conditional process modeling, and confirmatory factor analysis with categorical indicators. Other additions to this masterpiece of pedagogy include insightful discussions of significance testing, the use of bootstrap estimation, and the principles of measurement theory. Although Rex suggests in his Introduction that no single book can cover all of SEM, his book is about as thorough as they come. His didactic approach is refreshing and engaging, and the breadth and depth of material covered is simply impressive. As he notes and you will feel. Rex is a researcher talking to you as a fellow researcher, carefully explaining in conceptually driven terms the logic and principles that underlie the world of SEM. The wealth of examples provide entry points for researchers across a broad array of disciplines. This book will speak to you regardless of your field or specific area of expertise.

  abstract = {To address global environmental challenges it is crucial to understand how humans make decisions about environmentally relevant behaviour, since a shift to alternative behaviours can make a relevant difference. This paper proposes a comprehensive model of determinants of individual environmentally relevant behaviour based on a combination of the most common theories in environmental psychology. The model is tested using a meta-analytical structural equation modelling approach based on a pool of 56 different data sets with a variety of target behaviours. The model is supported by the data. Intentions to act, perceived behavioural control and habits were identified as direct predictors of behaviour. Intentions are predicted by attitudes, personal and social norms, and perceived behavioural control. Personal norms are predicted by social norms, perceived behavioural control, awareness of consequences, ascription of responsibility, an ecological world view and self-transcendence values. Self-enhancement values have a negative impact on personal norms. Based on the model, interventions to change behaviour need not only to include attitude campaigns but also a focus on de-habitualizing behaviour, strengthening the social support and increasing self-efficacy by concrete information about how to act. Value based interventions have only an indirect effect.},

Hence, researchers resort to scaling methods, such as fixed marker, effects coding, or fixed factor, to assign scales to the latent variables. The use of such procedures results in numerically different estimates, in spite of a single underlying population model. In this paper, we provide a framework which not only allows for a translation between estimates obtained under different scaling methods, but also helps to explore the relation between the underlying population parameters and their estimates, thus providing a basis for the interpretation of estimated parameters. Additionally, the framework proves useful for demonstrating that the choice of scaling method affects the power of the Wald test for testing parameters' significance.},

Although these methods traditionally were capable of detecting only uniform measurement bias, RFA can be extended with latent moderated structural equations (LMS) to assess nonuniform measurement bias. As LMS is implemented in limited structural equation modeling (SEM) computer programs (e.g., Mplus), we propose the use of the product indicator (PI) method in RFA models, which is available in any SEM software. Using simulated data, we illustrate how to apply this method to test for measurement bias, and we compare the conclusions with those reached using LMS in Mplus. Both methods obtain comparable results, indicating that the PI method is a viable alternative to LMS for researchers without access to SEM software featuring LMS.},

We conducted a simulation study to compare two empirical anchor-selection strategies: a one-step rank-based strategy and an iterative selection procedure. Unlike the iterative procedure, the rank-based strategy had a low risk and degree of contamination within the empirically selected anchor set, even with small samples. To detect nonuniform DIF, RFA requires an interaction effect with the latent factor. The latent moderated structural equations (LMS) method has been applied to RFA and has revealed inflated Type I error rates. We propose using product indicators (PI) as a more widely available alternative to measure the latent interaction. A simulation study, involving several sample-size conditions and magnitudes of uniform and nonuniform DIF, revealed that PI obtained similar power but lower Type I error rates, as compared to LMS.},

Self-reported PEB measures in surveys often contain non-negligible measurement error that can bias estimates and lead to incorrect findings. Given the potential presence of error, we hypothesize that changes to the way self-reported PEB is measured might lead to systematic measurement errors that affect the validity of results. Study 1 (N~=~951) showed that priming participants with related scales like environmentalist identity did not substantively change reported behavior (all ds {$\leq$} 0.12). To investigate the possibility of overreporting without priming, Study 2 (N~=~385) measured littering prevention behavior using the Unmatched Count Technique. A standard questionnaire format led to much higher reported behavior compared to the more anonymous covert condition, d~=~0.53, and this effect appeared driven by participants who reported a stronger environmentalist identity. These results may help to explain some of the observed error in PEB measures. We suggest that researchers could reduce measurement bias with indirect questioning techniques.},

  abstract = {Numerous theoretical frameworks have been developed to explain the gap between the possession of environmental knowledge and environmental awareness, and displaying pro-environmental behavior. Although many hundreds of studies have been undertaken, no definitive explanation has yet been found. Our article describes a few of the most influential and commonly used analytical frameworks: early US linear progression models; altruism, empathy and prosocial behavior models; and finally, sociological models. All of the models we discuss (and many of the ones we do not such as economic models, psychological models that look at behavior in general, social marketing models and that have become known as deliberative and inclusionary processes or procedures (DIPS)) have some validity in certain circumstances. This indicates that the question of what shapes pro-environmental behavior is such a complex one that it cannot be visualized through one single framework or diagram. We then analyze the factors that have been found to have some influence, positive or negative, on pro-environmental behavior such as demographic factors, external factors (e.g. institutional, economic, social and cultural) and internal factors (e.g. motivation, pro-environmental knowledge, awareness, values, attitudes, emotion, locus of control, responsibilities and priorities). Although we point out that developing a model that tries to incorporate all factors might neither be feasible nor useful, we feel that it can help illuminate this complex field. Accordingly, we propose our own model based on the work of Fliegenschnee and Schelakovsky (1998) who were influenced by Fietkau and Kessel (1981).},

However, this means that 79\% of the variance in the association between self-reported and objective behavior remains unexplained, which is especially troubling given the environmental context. We conclude that although this effect size is conventionally large, it is functionally small for testing theory and devising intervention campaigns, possibly leading researchers to draw misleading conclusions about the usefulness of theories that employ self-reports to predict objective behavior.

  abstract = {Though calibration of an achievement test within psychological and educational context is very often carried out by the Rasch model, data sampling is hardly designed according to statistical foundations. However, Kubinger, Rasch, and Yanagida (2009) recently suggested an approach for the determination of sample size according to a given Type I and Type II risk, and a certain effect of model misfit when testing the Rasch model is supported by some new results. The approach uses a three-way analysis of variance design with mixed classification. There is a (fixed) group factor A, a (random) factor B of testees within A, and a (fixed) factor C of items cross-classified with. The simulation study in this article deals with further item parameter ranges and ability parameter distributions, and with larger sample sizes and item numbers than the original paper. The results are: The approach works given several restrictions, and its main aim, the determination of the sample size, is attained. {\copyright} 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

The motivation to be accurate enhances use of those beliefs and strategies that are considered most appropriate, whereas the motivation to arrive at particular conclusions enhances use of those that are considered most likely to yield the desired conclusion. There is considerable evidence that people are more likely to arrive at conclusions that they want to arrive at, but their ability to do so is constrained by their ability to construct seemingly reasonable justifications for these conclusions. These ideas can account for a wide variety of research concerned with motivated reasoning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Therefore, this paper reviews the issue of what sample size and sample power the researcher should have in the EFA, CFA, and SEM study. Statistical power is the estimation of the sample size that is appropriate for an analysis. In any study, four parameters related to power analysis are Alpha, Beta, statistical power and Effect size. They are prerequisites for a priori sample size determination. Scale development in general and Factor Analysis (EFA, CFA) and SEM are large sample size methods because sample affects precision and replicability of the results. However, the existing literature provides limited and sometimes conflicting guidance on this issue. Generally, for EFA the stronger the data, the smaller the sample can be for an accurate analysis. In CFA and SEM parameter estimates, chi-square tests and goodness of fit indices are equally sensitive to sample size. So the statistical power and precision of CFA/SEM parameter estimates are also influenced by sample size. In this work after reviewing existing sample power analysis rules along with more elaborated methods (like Monte Carlo simulation), we conclude with suggestions for small samples in factor analysis found in literature.},

The objective of this study is to determine which individual actions have the largest potential for reducing household greenhouse gas emissions. Past behavior change research has focused on the reduction potential of direct emissions in one or two household domains at a time, often overlooking the indirect emissions associated with food consumption. Here, the potential greenhouse gas emissions reductions are compared for seven individual pro-environmental behaviors in the transportation, housing, and food domains. For the average household in North America and Europe, eating fewer animal products has the largest greenhouse gas emissions reduction potential of the behaviors studied, followed by switching to more fuel-efficient vehicles. Additional analyses reveal that air transportation might have larger emission reduction potential than dietary changes, especially for higher-income households that fly frequently. Targeting these high-impact behaviors will be more cost-beneficial for climate change policies and programs. This study can help guide these intervention efforts.},

Some of these problems can be addressed by studying consequential behavior in behavioral paradigms (i.e., systematically arranged situations of actual environmental relevance). However, pro-environmental behavior paradigms have been scattered across disciplines, and many researchers may not be aware of the wealth of available paradigms. The present review aims to acquaint researchers across disciplinary borders with the behavioral paradigms developed to study pro-environmental behavior in different domains. A systematic literature search revealed 99 ad hoc paradigms and five validated paradigms of pro-environmental behavior. I review how different authors have succeeded in implementing the consequences of pro-environmental behavior in standardized field, laboratory, or online situations, point to caveats in the use of behavioral paradigms, and illustrate how researchers can select a paradigm for their own research.},

Researchers observe naturally occurring pro-environmental behaviors, ask people to complete self-report scales, or devise behavioral tasks with ecological consequences. These approaches have been claimed to yield measures of pro-environmental behavior. The present paper argues that this terminology is misleading. Some pro-environmental behavior researchers measure behavioral properties of pro-environmental behaviors (e.g., frequency, duration), while others apparently aim to measure more or less general person properties (e.g., pro-environmental propensity or preference). Behavioral properties and person properties are logically distinct, but they become conflated when researchers indiscriminately refer to observations, items, scales, and tasks as measures of pro-environmental behavior. As a result, researchers may end up evaluating their purported measures against irrelevant quality criteria, expecting convergence where it cannot be expected, using methods inconsistent with their research goal, and making spurious conclusions. They erroneously consider multi-item scales and behavioral tasks as measures of the same construct, examine the construct validity of procedures that cannot reasonably be assumed to capture a psychological construct, or mistake the correlates of person properties for the determinants of behavior. To promote a cumulative science of pro-environmental behavior and prevent misguided research efforts, researchers should carefully distinguish between measurement targets and avoid claiming that they ``measured pro-environmental behavior''.},

Here we exploit the regional variation to test for the effect of experiencing extreme temperatures on perceptions of resource security and on related pro-environmental behaviour. We analyse data from 2,189 individuals across the UK over a 7\,day period and use a difference-in-differences estimation to compare responses of individuals in regions subjected to extreme temperatures with those of individuals in regions that were not subjected to extreme temperatures4. We show that exposure to extreme temperatures had a large and statistically significant effect on perceptions of energy security but not on stated pro-environmental behaviour. We find less evidence that extreme temperatures had an effect on perceptions of food and water security.},

  abstract = {Despite threats posed to communities from wildfire, few tools exist to aid emergency managers in recommending evacuations. An evacuation trigger buffer is a pre-established boundary encompassing a community or asset that triggers an evacuation recommendation should a fire cross the edge of the buffer. The Wildland--Urban Interface Evacuation model (WUIVAC) delineates evacuation trigger buffers based on modeled fire-spread rates and estimated evacuation times. A point along the edge of a WUIVAC-generated trigger buffer represents the modeled shortest time required for a fire to travel to a community. The objective of this research is to use data from the 2003 Cedar Fire in southern California to evaluate the temporal and spatial differences between evacuation trigger buffers as generated by WUIVAC and the perimeter and spread of a historical fire. Three trigger buffers surrounding a test community were created for hourly increments and analyzed in conjunction with the equivalent hourly locations of the leading edge of the Cedar Fire. The novel use of forecast winds yielded dynamic trigger buffers that varied with changes in wind speed and direction. The modeled trigger buffers exceeded the actual fire front by as much as 126m for the 1-h buffer and 1400m for the 3-h buffer, which implies that evacuees would have had slightly more time for evacuation than indicated by the trigger buffers. Had WUIVAC been used operationally during this event in the manner presented in this paper, it would have likely been successful in triggering an evacuation with enough time for the community to safely evacuate. This research represents a first step towards validating WUIVAC-modeled evacuation trigger buffers.},

Drawing on a survey of 1500 households in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland that developed both behavioral and attitudinal indices to investigate household consumption, we group respondents according to their scoring on each index. Results show that the socio-demographic and attitudinal profiles of households that report habitual pro-environmental behavior differ significantly from those that engage in once-off actions. This clearly impacts on environmental and sustainability policy, most notably the financial incentivization of sustainable consumption. Moreover, significant social sustainability issues arise, with rewards for once-off activities disproportionately benefiting better-off households while those who engage in routine pro-environmental behavior tend to face higher costs.},

  abstract = {Climate change is a threat to human societies and natural ecosystems, yet public opinion research finds that public awareness and concern vary greatly. Here, using an unprecedented survey of 119 countries, we determine the relative influence of socio-demographic characteristics, geography, perceived well-being, and beliefs on public climate change awareness and risk perceptions at national scales. Worldwide, educational attainment is the single strongest predictor of climate change awareness. Understanding the anthropogenic cause of climate change is the strongest predictor of climate change risk perceptions, particularly in Latin America and Europe, whereas perception of local temperature change is the strongest predictor in many African and Asian countries. However, other key factors associated with public awareness and risk perceptions highlight the need to develop tailored climate communication strategies for individual nations. The results suggest that improving basic education, climate literacy, and public understanding of the local dimensions of climate change are vital to public engagement and support for climate action.},

  abstract = {Multiple comparisons tests (MCTs) are performed several times on the mean of experimental conditions. When the null hypothesis is rejected in a validation, MCTs are performed when certain experimental conditions have a statistically significant mean difference or there is a specific aspect between the group means. A problem occurs if the error rate increases while multiple hypothesis tests are performed simultaneously. Consequently, in an MCT, it is necessary to control the error rate to an appropriate level. In this paper, we discuss how to test multiple hypotheses simultaneously while limiting type I error rate, which is caused by {$\alpha$} inflation. To choose the appropriate test, we must maintain the balance between statistical power and type I error rate. If the test is too conservative, a type I error is not likely to occur. However, concurrently, the test may have insufficient power resulted in increased probability of type II error occurrence. Most researchers may hope to find the best way of adjusting the type I error rate to discriminate the real differences between observed data without wasting too much statistical power. It is expected that this paper will help researchers understand the differences between MCTs and apply them appropriately.},

By expressing the FIML estimator as a special MI estimator, we predicted the expected patterns of discrepancy between the two estimators. Via Monte Carlo simulation studies where we have access to the original complete data, we compare the performance of FIML and MI estimators to that of the complete data maximum likelihood (ML) estimator under a wide range of conditions, including differences in sample size, percent of missingness, and degrees of model misfit. Our study confirmed well-known knowledge that the two estimators tend to yield essentially equivalent results to each other and to those from analysis of complete data when the postulated model is correctly specified. However, some noteworthy patterns of discrepancies were found between the FIML and MI estimators when the hypothesized model does not hold exactly in the population: MI-based parameter estimates, comparative fit index (CFI), and the Tucker Lewis index (TLI) tend to be closer to the counterparts of the complete data ML estimates, whereas FIML-based chi-squares and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) tend to be closer to the counterparts of the complete data ML estimates. We explained the observed patterns of discrepancy between the two estimators as a function of the interplay between the parsimony and accuracy of the imputation model. We concluded by discussing practical and methodological implications and issues for further research.

Although it has been argued that the two classes of missing data procedures are essentially equivalent, we showed that they may not produce equivalent results as practiced empirically under realistic conditions where researchers work with imperfect models. Following a review of relevant estimation theory, we have made specific a priori predictions on the expected patterns of the discrepancy between FIML and MI estimators, with respect to parameter estimates, their associated sampling variabilities, and the goodness of fit indices. Via Monte Carlo simulation studies where we have access to the original complete data, we showed that the two classes of procedures exhibit subtle but important differences in their performance in relation to the results from complete data analysis. Based on our theoretical predictions and the observed patterns, we provided a few practical recommendations and directions for future research.

A Monte Carlo simulation study was carried out to compare the performance of ML, DWLS, and ULS in estimating model parameters, and their robust corrections to standard errors, and chi-square statistics in a structural equation model with ordinal observed variables. Eighty-four conditions, characterized by different ordinal observed distribution shapes, numbers of response categories, and sample sizes were investigated. Results reveal that (a) DWLS and ULS yield more accurate factor loading estimates than ML across all conditions; (b) DWLS and ULS produce more accurate interfactor correlation estimates than ML in almost every condition; (c) structural coefficient estimates from DWLS and ULS outperform ML estimates in nearly all asymmetric data conditions; (d) robust standard errors of parameter estimates obtained with robust ML are more accurate than those produced by DWLS and ULS across most conditions; and (e) regarding robust chi-square statistics, robust ML is inferior to DWLS and ULS in controlling for Type I error in almost every condition, unless a large sample is used (N ϭ 1,000). Finally, implications of the findings are discussed, as are the limitations of this study as well as potential directions for future research.},

The authors conclude that on-line judgments of an action's self-concept compatibility affect the perspective used for image construction. Study 5 shows applied implications. Use of the 3rd-person perspective when recalling past episodes of overindulgent eating was related to optimism about behaving differently at an upcoming Thanksgiving dinner.

PRO differs from other measurements because such patient characteristics cannot be directly observed. Item response theory (IRT) is an attractive way for PRO analysis. However, in the framework of IRT, sample size justification is rarely provided or ignores the fact that PRO measures are latent variables with the use of formulas developed for observed variables. It might therefore be inappropriate and might provide inadequately sized studies. The objective was to develop valid sample size methodology for the comparison of PRO in two groups of patients using IRT. The proposed approach takes into account questionnaire's items parameters, the difference of the latent variables means, and its variance whose derivation is approximated using Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). We also computed the associated power. We realized a simulation study taking into account sample size, number of items, and value of the group effect. We compared power obtained from CRB with the one obtained from simulations (SIM) and with the power based on observed variables (OBS). For a given sample size, powers using CRB and SIM were similar and always lower than OBS. We observed a strong impact of the number of items for CRB and SIM, the power increasing with the questionnaire's length but not for OBS. In the context of latent variables, it seems important to use an adapted sample size formula because the formula developed for observed variables seems to be inadequate and leads to an underestimated study size.},

A key benefit of the orthogonalizing strategy is that it eliminated the need to estimate a mean structure as required by the mean-centering strategy, but required a potentially cumbersome 2-step estimation procedure. In contrast, the double-mean-centering strategy eliminates both the need for the mean structure and the cumbersome 2-stage estimation procedure. Furthermore, although the orthogonalizing and double-mean-centering strategies are equivalent when all indicators are normally distributed, the double-mean-centering strategy is superior when this normality assumption is violated. In summary, we recommend that applied researchers wanting to estimate latent interaction effects use the double-mean-centering strategy instead of either the single-mean-centering or orthogonalizing strategies, thus allowing them to ignore the cumbersome mean structure.},

  abstract = {A non-arbitrary method for the identification and scale setting of latent variables in general structural equation modeling is introduced. This particular technique provides identical model fit as traditional methods (e.g., the marker variable method), but it allows one to estimate the latent parameters in a nonarbitrary metric that reflects the metric of the measured indicators. This technique, therefore, is particularly useful for mean and covariance structures (MACS) analyses, where the means of the indicators and latent constructs are of key interest. By introducing this alternative method of identification and scale setting, researchers are provided with an additional tool for conducting MACS analyses that provides a meaningful and nonarbitrary scale for the estimates of the latent variable parameters. Importantly, this tool can be used with single-group single-occasion models as well as with multiple-group models, multiple-occasion models, or both.},

  abstract = {An up-to-date, comprehensive treatment of a classic text on missing data in statisticsThe topic of missing data has gained considerable attention in recent decades. This new edition by two acknowledged experts on the subject offers an up-to-date account of practical methodology for handling missing data problems. Blending theory and application, authors Roderick Little and Donald Rubin review historical approaches to the subject and describe simple methods for multivariate analysis with missing values. They then provide a coherent theory for analysis of problems based on likelihoods derived from statistical models for the data and the missing data mechanism, and then they apply the theory to a wide range of important missing data problems.Statistical Analysis with Missing Data, Third Edition starts by introducing readers to the subject and approaches toward solving it. It looks at the patterns and mechanisms that create the missing data, as well as a taxonomy of missing data. It then goes on to examine missing data in experiments, before discussing complete-case and available-case analysis, including weighting methods. The new edition expands its coverage to include recent work on topics such as nonresponse in sample surveys, causal inference, diagnostic methods, and sensitivity analysis, among a host of other topics.  An updated ``classic'' written by renowned authorities on the subject Features over 150 exercises (including many new ones) Covers recent work on important methods like multiple imputation, robust alternatives to weighting, and Bayesian methods Revises previous topics based on past student feedback and class experience Contains an updated and expanded bibliography  The authors were awarded The Karl Pearson Prize in 2017 by the International Statistical Institute, for a research contribution that has had profound influence on statistical theory, methodology or applications. Their work "has been no less than defining and transforming." (ISI)Statistical Analysis with Missing Data, Third Edition is an ideal textbook for upper undergraduate and/or beginning graduate level students of the subject. It is also an excellent source of information for applied statisticians and practitioners in government and industry.},

  abstract = {Background Climate change is likely to increase the threat of wildfires, and little is known about how wildfires affect health in exposed communities. A better understanding of the impacts of the resulting air pollution has important public health implications for the present day and the future. Method We performed a systematic search to identify peer-reviewed scientific studies published since 1986 regarding impacts of wildfire smoke on health in exposed communities. We reviewed and synthesized the state of science of this issue including methods to estimate exposure, and identified limitations in current research. Results We identified 61 epidemiological studies linking wildfire and human health in communities. The U.S. and Australia were the most frequently studied countries (18 studies on the U.S., 15 on Australia). Geographic scales ranged from a single small city (population about 55,000) to the entire globe. Most studies focused on areas close to fire events. Exposure was most commonly assessed with stationary air pollutant monitors (35 of 61 studies). Other methods included using satellite remote sensing and measurements from air samples collected during fires. Most studies compared risk of health outcomes between 1) periods with no fire events and periods during or after fire events, or 2) regions affected by wildfire smoke and unaffected regions. Daily pollution levels during or after wildfire in most studies exceeded U.S. EPA regulations. Levels of PM10, the most frequently studied pollutant, were 1.2 to 10 times higher due to wildfire smoke compared to non-fire periods and/or locations. Respiratory disease was the most frequently studied health condition, and had the most consistent results. Over 90\% of these 45 studies reported that wildfire smoke was significantly associated with risk of respiratory morbidity. Conclusion Exposure measurement is a key challenge in current literature on wildfire and human health. A limitation is the difficulty of estimating pollution specific to wildfires. New methods are needed to separate air pollution levels of wildfires from those from ambient sources, such as transportation. The majority of studies found that wildfire smoke was associated with increased risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Children, the elderly and those with underlying chronic diseases appear to be susceptible. More studies on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are needed. Further exploration with new methods could help ascertain the public health impacts of wildfires under climate change and guide mitigation policies.},

Starting from the local water balance, it is shown that a universal description of drought requires reference to water supply, demand and management. The influence of human intervention through water management is shown to be intrinsic to the definition of drought in the universal sense and can only be eliminated in the case of purely meteorological drought. The state of drought is shown to be predicated on the existence of climatological norms for a multitude of process-specific terms. In general, these norms are either difficult to obtain or even non-existent in the non-stationary context of climate change. Such climatological considerations, in conjunction with the difficulty of quantifying human influence, lead to the conclusion that we cannot reasonably expect the existence of any workable generalised objective definition of drought.},

Research on Type D personality serves as a good case study for that matter. In Study 1, we fitted a multivariate interaction model to predict depression and anxiety with Type D personality, operationalized as an interaction between its two subcomponents negative affectivity (NA) and social inhibition (SI). We constructed this interaction according to four approaches: (1) sum score product; (2) single product indicator; (3) matched product indicators; and (4) latent moderated structural equations (LMS). In Study 2, we compared these interaction models in a simulation study by assessing for each method the bias and precision of the estimated interaction effect under varying conditions. In Study 1, all methods showed a significant Type D effect on both depression and anxiety, although this effect diminished after including the NA and SI quadratic effects. Study 2 showed that the LMS approach performed best with respect to minimizing bias and maximizing power, even when item scores were ordinal and skewed. However, when latent traits were skewed LMS resulted in more false-positive conclusions, while the Matched PI approach adequately controlled the false-positive rate.},

They assume that people assess the desirability and likelihood of possible outcomes of choice alternatives and integrate this information through some type of expectation-based calculus to arrive at a decision. The authors propose an alternative theoretical perspective, the risk-as-feelings hypothesis, that highlights the role of affect experienced at the moment of decision making. Drawing on research from clinical, physiological, and other subfields of psychology, they show that emotional reactions to risky situations often diverge from cognitive assessments of those risks. When such divergence occurs, emotional reactions often drive behavior. The risk-as-feelings hypothesis is shown to explain a wide range of phenomena that have resisted interpretation in cognitive--consequentialist terms.

Then, the analysis process should be continued with a confirmatory factor analysis to assess whether the hypothesis proposed in the exploratory step is plausible in the population. To carry out the analysis, researchers usually collect a single sample, and then split it into two halves. As no specific splitting methods have been proposed to date in the context of factor analysis, researchers use a random split approach.

  abstract = {Science communication aims to motivate action on climate change. We examined the usefulness of two related communication strategies: proximising climate change with news focussing on local impacts, and bridging psychological distance by raising the salience of people's global identity as part of humanity. We first examined the often implicitly assumed process underlying proximising, namely reducing the psychological socio-spatial distance of climate change, which in turn might make the issue more relevant for people, which in turn might promote behavioural engagement. Second, we argued that when people consider themselves as part of a global society, proximising may not be necessary as people perceive the relevance of distant impacts. We conducted an experiment with UK residents (N = 400) with two between subjects factors: proximity of communication on climate change (proximal or distant) and global identity salience (communicated or not). Communicating proximity (vs. distance) via a news text on climate change consequences for either the UK or Bangladesh reduced the psychological sociospatial distance of climate change and indirectly predicted climate protective behaviour through lower psychological socio-spatial distance and higher relevance attribution. While these indirect relations were small, stronger relations might arise if people repeatedly receive local information. Participants for whom global identity was made salient (using a video showing a man dancing with people all over the world) exhibited no decreases in evaluating the relevance of the news text as their psychological socio-spatial distance of climate change increased (compared to those who viewed a control video). This indicates that global identity salience can bridge the psychological sociospatial distance of climate change. We conclude that it is useful to report local consequences of climate change, or to communicate global connectedness if global consequences of climate change are described.},

In the article, the authors examine how survey participants' personal experiences of extreme events and climate-related changes in the natural environment influenced their perceptions of climate change. Using data from a nationally representative survey conducted in Norway in 2015 and the results of logistic regressions, the authors find that individual observations of changes in nature were linked to higher levels of concern with regard to climate change, as well as to attitudes that were more positive towards personal mitigation and adaption efforts. Somewhat counter-intuitively, they also find that participants who had personally experienced a natural hazard event were less concerned about climate change compared with participants without such experiences. The authors conclude that personal experience of the consequences of climate change may in some cases have a limited effect on enhancing people's concerns about climate change.},

Investigations into such psychological distancing---removal from an egocentric reference point--- have suggested similarities between geographical space, time, probability, and social distance. We draw on these similarities to propose that experiencing any kind of distance will reduce sensitivity to any other distance. Nine studies varied the initial distance of an event and assessed sensitivity to a second distance. Consistently, people were less responsive to a given span of distance when it was distal versus proximal. This effect held using each of the four distances as the initial instantiation of distance; it also held using each dimension to assess sensitivity to distance (i.e., as the second distance dimension). These findings suggest that the dimensions of psychological distance share a common, interchangeable meaning and that the cross-dimension difference between far and further is less than that between near and far.},

  abstract = {Background and Objective: Currently, climate change represents an existential, physical, and psychological threat. Therefore, mitigation and adaptation actions and measures have become increasingly necessary to preserve individual and collective well-being. The psychological distance is one of the main psychological constructs that explains the most concrete or abstract perception of the objects and events surrounding people. The psychological distance is a multidimensional construct, and in accordance with the construal level theory (CLT), temporal, hypothetical, spatial, and social distance are considered the most critical dimensions. This systematic review aims to provide an update of the literature on the role of psychological distance in the commitment to engagement mitigation and adaptation attitudes toward climate change.Method: The review was carried out following PRISMA guidelines and a systematic search was performed on PubMed, Psycinfo, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus databases.Results: Nineteen articles have been identified as being eligible for the final synthesis. Results showed, in general, that individuals have a higher propensity to perform pro-environmental and resilient behaviors against climate change when it is perceived as more proximal and concrete within the construct of psychological distance. However, not all studies show this result. Some studies showed that, despite people considering climate changes as real and tangible, they do not perform mitigation and adaptation behaviors. Other studies showed that people implement these behaviors despite perceiving climate changes as distal and abstract.Conclusions: The current literature shows the existence of a relation among psychological distance and pro-environmental and resilient behaviors applied to climate change. For a deeper understanding of the conflicting results that emerged, more studies are necessary to explore the possible presence of further psychological variables involved in the relation within psychological distance, mitigation, and adaptation in environmental contexts.},

These scales are based on the damage that a tornado causes. Another measure of the strength of a tornado is its path length of touchdown, L. In this study we consider severe tornadoes, which we define as L{$\geq$}10 km, in the continental USA (USA Storm Prediction Center Severe Weather Database). We find that for the period 1982--2011, for individual severe tornadoes (L{$\geq$}10 km): (i) There is a strong linear scaling between the number of severe tornadoes in a year and their total path length in that year. (ii) The cumulative frequency path length data suggests that, not taking into account any changing trends over time, we would expect in a given year (on average) one severe tornado with a path length L{$\geq$}115 km and in a decade (on average) one severe tornado with a path length L\&ge;215 km. (iii) The noncumulative frequency-length statistics of severe tornado touchdown path lengths, 20L\&lt;200 km, is well approximated by an inverse power-law relationship with exponent near 3. We then take the total path length of severe tornadoes in a convective day (12:00--12:00 UTC), LD, as a measure of the strength of a 24-h USA tornado outbreak. We find that: (i) For 1982--2011, the number of severe tornadoes in a USA convective day outbreak has a strong power-law relationship (exponent 0.80) on the convective day total path length, LD. (ii) For 1952--2011, the cumulative frequency path length data for severe tornado outbreaks suggests that we would expect in a given year (on average) one daily severe tornado outbreak with total path length LD{$\geq$}480 km and in a decade (on average) one daily severe tornado outbreak with a total path length LD{$\geq$}1200 km. (iii) For 1982--2011, the noncumulative frequency-length statistics of tornado outbreaks, 10LD\&lt;1000 km d-1, is well approximated by an inverse power-law relationship with exponent near 1.8. Finally, we consider the frequency path-length scaling of severe tornadoes (L{$\geq$}10 km) during two tornado outbreaks, 27 April 2011 (67 severe tornadoes) and 25 May 2011 (16 severe tornadoes), and find similar statistical distributions with robust scaling. We believe that our robust scaling results provide evidence that touchdown path lengths can be used as quantitative measures of the systematic properties of severe tornadoes and severe tornado outbreaks.},

He points out that widely accepted cutoff values for approximate fit indices have come to be treated as if they were test statistics. Paul cites four recent studies of the behaviour of fit indices under varying data conditions which demonstrate that universal indicative cutoff values cannot be trusted. Based upon these studies, Paul advocates the abandonment of approximate fit indices and greater reliance on the chi square test and a broader assessment strategy that includes predictive accuracy. I share Paul's concerns about the lax standards often adopted in model testing and I agree with most of his arguments. However, the authors he cites in support of his recommendation to abandon approximate fit indices do not reach the same conclusion as Paul. In my response to Paul's article, I discuss some conditions under which it could be legitimate to accept a model which has failed the chi square test and I contend that approximate fit indices can play a useful part in a multi-faceted strategy for determining model adequacy, provided they are not elevated to the status of golden rules. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The behaviors included in this scale are those identified by environmental scientists as having the greatest impact on the environment. Principal components analysis generated a 19-item scale with four dimensions. Coefficient alpha for the full scale was.76. Coefficient alphas for the subscales ranged from .62 to .74.

  abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events (e.g. flooding, heat waves, and wildfires). As a result, it is often reasoned that as more individuals experience unusual weather patterns that are consistent with changing climate conditions, the more their concern about global warming will increase, and the more motivated they will become to respond and address the problem effectively. Social science research evaluating the relationships between personal experiences with and risk perceptions of climate change, however, show mixed results. Here, we analyze a representative statewide survey of Floridians and compare their risk perceptions of five-year trends in climate change with local weather station data from the five years preceding the survey. The results show that Floridians are unable to detect five-year increases in temperature, but some can detect changes in precipitation. Despite an inability to detect the correct direction of change, respondents were significantly more likely than not to correctly identify the season in which most change occurred. Nevertheless, compared to local experience, risk perceptions of climate change were more strongly predicted by subjective experiences of environmental change, personal beliefs about climate change, and political ideology. Results from the study suggest that long-term changes in climate patterns and extreme weather events need to be interpreted by weather and climate experts within the context of climate change; individuals cannot be expected to detect or comprehend such complex linkages directly.},

Over the last decade, as scientific certainty about the causes and impacts of, and solutions to the climate crisis has increased, cities, states, and regions in the United States have pursued diverse policy strategies. Yet, our understanding of how Americans' climate views are changing remains largely limited to national trends. Here we use a large US survey dataset () to estimate dynamic, state-level changes in 16 climate change beliefs, risk perceptions, and policy preferences over 13 years (2008--2020). We find increases in global warming issue importance and perceived harm in every state. Policy support, however, increased in more liberal states like California and New York, but remained stable elsewhere. Year-by-year estimates of state-level climate opinions can be used to support sub-national mitigation and adaptation efforts that depend on public support and engagement.},

However, because standard errors for these two paths were so huge (.25) thanks to the extremely high correlation between self-concept and self-efficacy (r = .93), interpretations were problematic. In a model comparison approach to this multicollinearity problem, constraining these two paths to be equal provided a better, more parsimonious fit to the data and also substantially reduced the standard errors (from .25 to .03).

For these data, there is a well established ESEM structure but typical CFA models do not fit the data and substantially inflate correlations among the nine SET factors (median rs = .34 for ESEM, .72 for CFA) in a way that undermines discriminant validity and usefulness as diagnostic feedback. A 13-model taxonomy of ESEM measurement invariance is proposed, showing complete invariance (factor loadings, factor correlations, item uniquenesses, item intercepts, latent means) over multiple groups based on the SETs collected in the first and second halves of a 13-year period. Fully latent ESEM growth models that unconfounded measurement error from communality showed almost no linear or quadratic effects over this 13-year period. Latent multiple indicators multiple causes models showed that relations with background variables (workload/difficulty, class size, prior subject interest, expected grades) were small in size and varied systematically for different ESEM SET factors, supporting their discriminant validity and a construct validity interpretation of the relations. A new approach to higher order ESEM was demonstrated, but was not fully appropriate for these data. Based on ESEM methodology, substantively important questions were addressed that could not be appropriately addressed with a traditional CFA approach.},

Part of the problem is undue reliance on overly restrictive CFAs in which each item loads on only one factor. Exploratory SEM (ESEM), an overarching integration of the best aspects of CFA/SEM and traditional EFA, provides confirmatory tests of a priori factor structures, relations between latent factors and multigroup/multioccasion tests of full (mean structure) measurement invariance. It incorporates all combinations of CFA factors, ESEM factors, covariates, grouping/multiple-indicator multiple-cause (MIMIC) variables, latent growth, and complex structures that typically have required CFA/SEM. ESEM has broad applicability to clinical studies that are not appropriately addressed either by traditional EFA or CFA/SEM.},

  abstract = {Scalar invariance is an unachievable ideal that in practice can only be approximated; often using potentially questionable approaches such as partial invariance based on a stepwise selection of parameter estimates with large modification indices. Study 1 demonstrates an extension of the power and flexibility of the alignment approach for comparing latent factor means in large-scale studies (30 OECD countries, 8 factors, 44 items, N = 249,840), for which scalar invariance is typically not supported in the traditional confirmatory factor analysis approach to measurement invariance (CFA-MI). Importantly, we introduce an alignment-within-CFA (AwC) approach, transforming alignment from a largely exploratory tool into a confirmatory tool, and enabling analyses that previously have not been possible with alignment (testing the invariance of uniquenesses and factor variances/covariances; multiple-group MIMIC models; contrasts on latent means) and structural equation models more generally. Specifically, it also allowed a comparison of gender differences in a 30-country MIMIC AwC (i.e., a SEM with gender as a covariate) and a 60-group AwC CFA (i.e., 30 countries {\texttimes} 2 genders) analysis. Study 2, a simulation study following up issues raised in Study 1, showed that latent means were more accurately estimated with alignment than with the scalar CFA-MI, and particularly with partial invariance scalar models based on the heavily criticized stepwise selection strategy. In summary, alignment augmented by AwC provides applied researchers from diverse disciplines considerable flexibility to address substantively important issues when the traditional CFA-MI scalar model does not fit the data.},

To better understand how the adversative effects of climate change can be mitigated, this study attempts to investigate the impact of socio-demographic factors on the mitigating actions of the individuals (MAOI) on climate change. Qualitative data were collected from a face-to-face survey of 360 respondents in the Kuala Lumpur region of Malaysia through a close-ended questionnaire. Analysis was conducted on the mediating effects of attitudinal variables through the path model by using the SEM. Findings indicate that the socio-demographic factors such as gender, age, education, income, and ethnicity can greatly influence the individual's awareness, attitude, risk perception, and knowledge of climate change issues. The results drawn from this study also revealed that the attitudinal factors act as a mediating effect between the socio-demographic factors and the MAOI, thereby, indicating that both the socio-demographic factors and the attitudinal factors have significant effects on the MAOI towards climate change. The outcome of this study can help policy makers and other private organizations to decide on the appropriate actions to take in managing climate change effects. These actions which encompass improving basic climate change education and making the public more aware of the local dimensions of climate change are important for harnessing public engagement and support that can also stimulate climate change awareness and promote mitigating actions to n protect the environment from the impact of climate change.},

  abstract = {The issue of climate change poses something of a puzzle. For all the attention accorded the issue, climate change/global warming has spawned surprisingly little grassroots activism in the contemporary United States. Drawing on social movement theory, the author seeks to explain this puzzle. The prevailing consensus among movement scholars is that the prospect for movement emergence is facilitated by the confluence of three factors: the expansion of political opportunities, the availability of mobilizing structures, and cognitive and affective mobilization through framing processes. The author then applies each of these factors to the case of climate change, arguing that (a) awareness of the issue developed during an especially inopportune period in American politics, (b) the organizations that arose to address the issue were ill suited to the kind of grassroots mobilization characteristic of successful movements, and (c) the amorphous nature of the issue played havoc with efforts at strategic framing.},

Despite its emphasis, psychological distance has not been widely studied in experimental work in the climate change context, and there is a need for more systematic examination of its effects across a range of mitigation and adaptation actions. Further, our review identifies potential pitfalls associated with decreasing psychological distance, such as fear and avoidance.

In Australia universities receive extra funding based on their academic publication rates and academic promotion is difficult without a good publication record. However, the reality is that only a small percentage of academics are actively publishing. To fix this problem, a number of international universities and other higher education institutions have implemented interventions with the main aim being to increase the number of publications. A comprehensive literature search identified 17 studies published between 1984 and 2004, which examined the effects of these interventions. Three key types of interventions were identified: writing courses, writing support groups and writing coaches. The resulting publication output varied, but all interventions led to an increase in average publication rates for the participants.},

In many circumstances, violating these assumptions yields estimates of reliability that are too small, making measures look less reliable than they actually are. Although methodological critiques of Cronbach's alpha are being cited with increasing frequency in empirical studies, in this tutorial we discuss how the trend is not necessarily improving methodology used in the literature. That is, many studies continue to use Cronbach's alpha without regard for its assumptions or merely cite methodological articles advising against its use to rationalize unfavorable Cronbach's alpha estimates. This tutorial first provides evidence that recommendations against Cronbach's alpha have not appreciably changed how empirical studies report reliability. Then, we summarize the drawbacks of Cronbach's alpha conceptually without relying on mathematical or simulation-based arguments so that these arguments are accessible to a broad audience. We continue by discussing several alternative measures that make less rigid assumptions which provide justifiably higher estimates of reliability compared to Cronbach's alpha. We conclude with empirical examples to illustrate advantages of alternative measures of reliability including omega total, Revelle's omega total, the greatest lower bound, and Coefficient H. A detailed software appendix is also provided to help researchers implement alternative methods. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Public knowledge, level of concern, and perceived personal efficacy, in positively affecting these issues are key variables in understanding public support for mitigation action. Previous research has documented some contradictory associations between knowledge, personal efficacy, and concern about global warming and climate change, but these cross-sectional findings limit inferences about temporal stability and direction of influence. This study examines the relationships between these three variables over a one-year period and three waves with national data from New Zealand. Results showed a positive association between the variables, and the pattern of findings was stable and consistent across the three data points. More importantly, results indicate that concern mediates the influence of knowledge on personal efficacy. Knowing more about global warming and climate change increases overall concern about the risks of these issues, and this increased concern leads to greater perceived efficacy and responsibility to help solving them. Implications for risk communication are discussed.},

The paper provides guidance to mitigate the occurrence of missing data through planning. Considerations include estimating expected missing data, intended vs unintended missing data, survey length, working with electronic surveys, choosing between standard and filtered form questions, forced responses and straight-lining, as well as responses that can generate missingness like ``I don't know'' and ``Not Applicable''. We introduce methods for analysing data with missing values, such as deletion, imputation and likelihood methods. The manuscript provides a framework and flow chart for choosing the appropriate analysis method based on how much missing data is observed and the type of missingness. Special circumstances involving missing data have been discussed, such as in studies with repeated or cohort measures, factor analysis or as part of data integration. Finally, a checklist of questions are provided for researchers to guide the reporting of the missing data when conducting future research.},

Historical rates of emissions decline due to such innovation of about 0.7\% are insufficient to offset the 3\% growth in emissions that stems from population and per capita income growth. Existing scientific and political debates are dominated by a ``technophilic optimism'' that projects emission reductions from technological improvement that are not supported by the evidence. If we fail to develop policies proactively to constrain population, affluence, and consumption while respecting other human values, we will almost certainly face impacts from climate change that constrain population, affluence, and consumption for us.},

  abstract = {Existing studies on the economic impact of wildfire smoke have focused on single fire events or entire seasons without considering the marginal effect of daily fire progression on downwind communities. Neither approach allows for an examination of the impact of even the most basic fire attributes, such as distance and fuel type, on air quality and health outcomes. Improved knowledge of these effects can provide important guidance for efficient wildfire management strategies. This study aims to bridge this gap using detailed information on 24 large-scale wildfires that sent smoke plumes to the Reno/Sparks area of Northern Nevada over a 4-year period. We relate the daily acreage burned by these fires to daily data on air pollutants and local hospital admissions. Using information on medical expenses, we compute the per-acre health cost of wildfires of different attributes. We find that patient counts can be causally linked to fires as far as 200--300 miles from the impact area. As expected, the marginal impact per acre burned generally diminishes with distance and for fires with lighter fuel loads. Our results also highlight the importance of allowing for temporal lags between fire occurrence and pollutant levels.},

  abstract = {Purpose The Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) is the leading method for assessing quality of life in patients with heart failure (HF) around the world. However, unique, culture-specific variations in factorial structure have been identified. The current study examined the cross-cultural equivalence of an Italian version of the MLHFQ. Design Cross-sectional assessment as part of an HF study in Italy. Patients (n = 1,192; mean age = 72 years, SD = 11) completed demographics, the MLHFQ, and the Short-Form 12 (SF-12). Methods A series of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to develop an appropriate factor model in the current sample. Findings We initially fit a confirmatory factor analysis based on published psychometric work validating the MLHFQ. This did not provide adequate fit, and the sample was then randomly split into equivalent subsets to conduct factor analyses with cross-validation. In the first subsample, an exploratory factor analysis uncovered slight modifications to the proposed factor structure that resulted in much improved model fit. The final model included a higher order factor and three subscales: physical, emotional, and social. A cross-validation confirmatory factor analysis using this structure was conducted in the remaining subset to ensure broader applicability of the results. Correlations with the SF-12 were consistent with previous work using these measures. Conclusions Some items of the MLHFQ are sensitive to differences across cultures, and factor structures vary based on where the scale is administered. In spite of these differences, the total score remains a valid and reliable indicator of quality of life in HF patients across cultures. Clinical Relevance Cultural influences on quality of life are important to consider when assessing patients' well-being in HF.},

A variety of tools have been developed to measure both environmental perception and PEB, challenging researchers to choose from the tools on offer. This study compares several measures, and finds that two widely used ones -- the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale and the Two Major Environmental Values (2-MEV) scale -- overlap, but have some significant differences. Combining the scales into a unified framework is possible, by retaining the `Preservation' and `Utilization' factors from 2-MEV and including an additional factor, `Eco-crisis' sensitivity, which is uniquely covered by NEP. Results of analysis of PEB also suggest that the validity of Rasch model-based tools, which consider estimates of behavioral difficulties, is superior to those of widely used composite variables. Insights on other measurement issues are also discussed in order to inform researchers and future developers of measurement instruments.},

In an absolute sense, these changing conditions constitute direct evidence of anthropogenic climate change. However, human evaluation of weather as either normal or abnormal will also be influenced by a range of factors including expectations, memory limitations, and cognitive biases. Here we show that experience of weather in recent years---rather than longer historical periods---determines the climatic baseline against which current weather is evaluated, potentially obscuring public recognition of anthropogenic climate change. We employ variation in decadal trends in temperature at weekly and county resolution over the continental United States, combined with discussion of the weather drawn from over 2 billion social media posts. These data indicate that the remarkability of particular temperatures changes rapidly with repeated exposure. Using sentiment analysis tools, we provide evidence for a ``boiling frog'' effect: The declining noteworthiness of historically extreme temperatures is not accompanied by a decline in the negative sentiment that they induce, indicating that social normalization of extreme conditions rather than adaptation is driving these results. Using climate model projections we show that, despite large increases in absolute temperature, anomalies relative to our empirically estimated shifting baseline are small and not clearly distinguishable from zero throughout the 21st century.},

The objective in this case is to discriminate between substantive and residual dependence in an, apparently, misspecified equation. Our paper tries to go further into the interpretation of this intermediate equation in both aspects. We include a small Monte Carlo study related to the LRCOM test and present some new results that facilitate the use, and the interpretation, of the Durbin equation in a more general context of discriminating between econometric models in a spatial context.},

Exploratory and Con{\textregistered}rmatory Factor Analyses (CFA) supported the original 3-factor structure of the SAS-A but retained fewer items than in the original scale. The revised scales demonstrated good internal consistency as well as criterion and concurrent validity. Despite including fewer items, psychometric characteristics of the revised scales were equivalent to or stronger than those reported in previous studies of the measure. As such, the present study provides initial support for the utility of the revised SAS-A as a measure of social anxiety in adolescent school samples. \# 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Two main modes of coping with social desirability bias are distinguished. The first mode comprises two methods aimed at the detection and measurement of social desirability bias: the use of social desirability scales, and the rating of item desirability. A second category comprises seven methods to prevent or reduce social desirability bias, including the use of forced-choice items, the randomized response technique, the bogus pipeline, self-administration of the questionnaire, the selection of interviewers, and the use of proxy subjects. Not one method was found to excel completely and under all conditions in coping with both other-deceptive and self-deceptive social desirability bias.

  abstract = {Social desirability is one of the most common sources of bias affecting the validity of experimental and survey research findings. From a self-presentational perspective, social desirability can be regarded as the resultant of two separate factors: self-deception and other-deception. Two main modes of coping with social desirability bias are distinguished. The first mode comprises two methods aimed at the detection and measurement of social desirability bias: the use of social desirability scales, and the rating of item desirability. A second category comprises seven methods to prevent or reduce social desirability bias, including the use of forced-choice items, the randomized response technique, the bogus pipeline, self-administration of the questionnaire, the selection of interviewers, and the use of proxy subjects. Not one method was found to excel completely and under all conditions in coping with both other-deceptive and self-deceptive social desirability bias. A combination of prevention and detection methods offers the best choice available.},

Whereas all missing data treatments are imperfect and are rooted in particular statistical assumptions, some missing data treatments are worse than others, on average (i.e., they lead to more bias in parameter estimates and less accurate hypothesis tests). Social scientists still routinely choose the more biased and error-prone techniques (listwise and pairwise deletion), likely due to poor familiarity with and misconceptions about the less biased/less error-prone techniques (maximum likelihood and multiple imputation). The current user-friendly review provides five easy-to-understand practical guidelines, with the goal of reducing missing data bias and error in the reporting of research results.

We find that US\$\${\textbackslash}\$\$\$143 billion per year of the costs of extreme events is attributable to climatic change. The majority (63\%), of this is due to human loss of life.

These analyses found openness was positively related to all five CCBs, neuroticism was positively related to four of five CCBs, and extraversion was positively related to three CCBs. In Study 2, 1688 US collegians completed the same measures as in Study 1 with two additional CCBs. They also indicated how efficacious they thought each CCB was. Each CCB was regressed on the Big Five. These results largely replicated those of Study 1 and also found that conscientiousness was positively related to five of seven CCBs. Mediational analyses found that all relationships between personality factors and CCB were mediated by the perceived efficacy of the CCB.

Despite their positive relationship and similar average welfare effects, the two records display a large discrepancy. Being endogenous, the selfreported record introduces the attenuation bias in analysing non-farm labour allocation in response to shocks.

Psychologists need to go further and, in particular, show that integrating psychological concepts into feasible interventions can reduce greenhouse gas emissions far more than would be achieved without such integration. While critiquing some aspects of current approaches, we describe psychological research that is pointing the way by distinguishing different types of behavior, acknowledging sociocultural context, and collaborating with other disciplines. Engaging this challenge offers psychologists new opportunities for promoting mitigation, advancing psychological understanding, and developing better interdisciplinary interactions.

The spillover effect proposes that engaging in one behavior affects the probability of engagement or disengaging in a second behavior. Therefore, the positive spillover effect predicts that interventions targeting one specific behavioral have the capacity to promote non-targeted and/or future pro-environmental behaviors. However, the negative spillover effect predicts that engaging in a first pro-environmental behavior will prevent or decrease a second pro-environmental behavior. Since the theoretical and empirical basis for positive and negative spillover effects are not sufficiently understood, the present paper (1) suggests a distinction between behavioral, temporal, and contextual spillovers (2) reviews the existing spillover research literature across a variety of environmental domains, (3) presents potential moderators governing the direction of spillover effects, and finally (4) discuss techniques to promote pro-environmental spillovers.},

To date, there is little guidance on if or how reports can be adjusted to better reflect true levels of a risk behavior in a given cohort, sample or, by extension, population. Methods We develop the underreporting correction factor (UCF), which can be used to correct estimates of the prevalence of a risk behavior using self-report of the behavior and a specific (but not necessarily sensitive) biomarker. The UCF rests on three assumptions: (1) there is no overreporting of the behavior, (2) the biomarker can only be acquired if the person engages in the behavior, and (3) the presence of the biomarker does not affect reporting of the behavior. We investigate the sensitivity of the UCF to violation of these assumptions and develop confidence intervals for the UCF and the corrected prevalence of the behavior. Results The UCF is most sensitive to the second assumption (biomarker perfectly specific). We apply the UCF to estimates of sexual risk behaviors in various settings using a variety of biomarkers. Conclusions Implementation of the UCF corrects for underreporting and more accurately quantifies risk in cohorts.},

DIF concerns the possibility that items on a scale work differently for different groups, such as females and males. DIF can accumulate across items on a scale to create DTF, which means the overall scale will have different levels of validity for the different groups. IRT is useful for conceptualizing DIF and DTF, and for conducting DIF analyses. Method: A DIF analysis of scores on Hudson's Multi-Problem Screening Inventory depression subscale illustrates the concepts of DIF and DTF and demonstrates an IRT analytical approach to detect possible DIF and DTF. Results: DIF was found in 3 of the items on the Multi-Problem Screening Inventory depression subscale, and evidence of possible DTF also was found. The magnitude of the DIF in one item was very large, but the potential DTF was small in magnitude. Conclusions: IRT is useful for conceptualizing DIF and DTF, and it has advantages for conducting DIF and DTF studies. Disadvantages include the need for large sample sizes. The risk of flawed inferences as a consequence of DIF and/or DTF in social work research is discussed.},

Yet, limited attention has been directed at investigating how individual differences in the subjective interpretation of extreme weather events as indications of climate change moderate the link between extreme weather experiences and climate change attitudes. This article contends that subjective attribution of extreme weather events to climate change is a necessary condition for extreme weather experiences to be translated into climate change mitigation responses, and that subjective attribution of extreme weather to climate change is influenced by the psychological and social contexts in which individuals appraise their experiences with extreme weather. Using survey data gathered in the aftermath of severe flooding across the UK in winter 2013/2014, personal experience of this flooding event is shown to only directly predict perceived threat from climate change, and indirectly predict climate change mitigation responses, among individuals who subjectively attributed the floods to climate change. Additionally, subjective attribution of the floods to climate change is significantly predicted by pre-existing climate change belief, political affiliation and perceived normative cues. Attempts to harness extreme weather experiences as a route to engaging the public must be attentive to the heterogeneity of opinion on the attributability of extreme weather events to climate change.},

Using national survey data from Norway, we show that individual and local flooding experiences differentially predict subjective attribution and climate change concern. People with individual flooding experience reported significantly greater climate change concern than those with local, or no, flooding experience. Subjective attribution of flooding to climate change did not differ significantly between people with individual versus local flooding experience, except among those with a right-wing political orientation where individual experience was associated with greater subjective attribution. Our findings highlight the need for careful operationalisation of flooding experience and climate change engagement in subsequent research.},

This efficacy will be judged by examining the percent of bias in estimating parameters. The focus of this paper is on structural equation modeling (SEM), a popular statistical technique, which subsumes many of the traditional statistical procedures. To make the comparison, this paper examines a full structural equation model that is generated by simulation in accord with previous research. The five techniques used for comparison are expectation maximization (EM), full information maximum likelihood (FIML), mean substitution (Mean), multiple imputation (MI), and regression imputation (Regression). All of these techniques, other than FIML, impute missing data and result in a complete dataset that can be used by researchers for other research. FIML, on the other hand, can still estimate the parameters of the model.},

  abstract = {Fear-inducing representations of climate change are widely employed in the public domain. However, there is a lack of clarity in the literature about the impacts that fearful messages in climate change communications have on people's senses of engagement with the issue and associated implications for public engagement strategies. Some literature suggests that using fearful representations of climate change may be counterproductive. The authors explore this assertion in the context of two empirical studies that investigated the role of visual, and iconic, representations of climate change for public engagement respectively. Results demonstrate that although such representations have much potential for attracting people's attention to climate change, fear is generally an ineffective tool for motivating genuine personal engagement. Nonthreatening imagery and icons that link to individuals' everyday emotions and concerns in the context of this macro-environmental issue tend to be the most engaging. Recommendations for constructively engaging individuals with climate change are given.},

Using indicators designed to measure a `safe and just' development space, we quantify the resource use associated with meeting basic human needs, and compare this to downscaled planetary boundaries for over 150 nations. We find that no country meets basic needs for its citizens at a globally sustainable level of resource use. Physical needs such as nutrition, sanitation, access to electricity and the elimination of extreme poverty could likely be met for all people without transgressing planetary boundaries. However, the universal achievement of more qualitative goals (for example, high life satisfaction) would require a level of resource use that is 2--6 times the sustainable level, based on current relationships. Strategies to improve physical and social provisioning systems, with a focus on sufficiency and equity, have the potential to move nations towards sustainability, but the challenge remains substantial.},

However, an increasing body of literature suggests that actual behavior systematically violates the neoclassical utility model. This paper reviews a number of alternative models for decision-making. Results from the literature show several examples of apparently ``irrational'' behavior that can be explained in terms of these alternative motivations. The paper also extends the received literature by examining in some detail the implications of one such model which is based on the psychological feeling of ambivalence. The paper demonstrates that ambivalence has the potential for explaining the appearance of intransitive choices, the use of rules of thumb in decision-making and the large discrepancies between stated willingness-to-pay and willingness-to-accept, all of which have been observed in various settings. There are potentially great rewards from innovative research that expands the neoclassical paradigm to incorporate additional motivational factors in decision-making.},

  abstract = {Scientists can now connect extreme weather events with climate change using a methodology known as ``extreme event attribution'', or EEA. The idea of connecting climate change and extreme weather has long been heralded as a panacea for communications, connecting the dangers of climate change to real-world, on-the-ground events. However, event attribution remains a nascent science, and attribution studies of the same event can sometimes produce divergent answers due to precise methodology used, variables examined, and the timescale selected for the event. The 2011--2017 California drought was assessed by 11 EEA studies which came to varying conclusions on its connection to climate change. This article uses the case study of the drought and a multi-methods approach to examine perceptions of EEA among key stakeholders and citizens. Twenty-five key informant interviews were conducted with different stakeholders: scientists performing EEA research, journalists, local and state-level policymakers, and non-governmental organization representatives. In addition, two focus groups with 20 California citizens were convened: one with environmentalists and another with agriculturalists. While climate change was viewed by many as a mild contributing factor to the California drought, many stakeholders had not heard of EEA or doubted that scientists could conclusively link the drought to anthropogenic climate change; those that were familiar with EEA felt that the science was generally uncertain. In the focus groups, presentation of divergent EEA results led participants to revert to pre-existing ideas about the drought-climate connection, or to question whether science had sufficiently advanced to analyze the event properly. These results indicate that while EEA continues to provoke interest and research in the scientific community, it is not currently utilized by many stakeholders, and may entrench the public in pre-existing views.},

Hence, private mitigation measures which proactively protect homes from being flooded or reduce flood damage are an essential part of modern flood risk management. This study analyses private flood mitigation measures among German households. The final data set covers more than 4200 households from all parts of the country, including flood plains as well as areas which are typically not at a high risk of riverine flooding. The results suggest that the propensity to mitigate flood damage increases i.a. with past damage experience and damage expectations for the future. The latter effect can be interpreted as a `climate adaptation signal' in the flood mitigation behaviour. All other factors remaining equal, a strong belief in a climate-change-induced increase of personal flood damage in the next decades correlates with an increase of the probability of flood mitigation by more than 10 percentage points. Moreover, empirical evidence for moral hazard in the flood mitigation behaviour cannot be observed. Households expecting insurance coverage do not reduce their mitigation efforts. Likewise, the expectation of government relief payments hinders mitigation only for some groups of households.},

We use a novel longitudinal dataset on revealed household behaviour and insured damage data to re-examine this relationship, which has mostly been studied by cross-sectional and self-reported data. Using a difference-in-differences estimator, we assess the causal effect of experiencing financial damage from the 2013 floods in Germany on the interest for renewable energy tariffs in online power portals, which we take as a proxy for engagement in climate protection. The results broadly confirm the expected positive effect of flood experience on climate engagement, but there are important non-linear effects. Most notably, the effect drops to zero if damage is very high meaning the causal effect of flood experience on interest in green energy holds only for moderately affected regions. One explanation for this inverted U-shaped effect is that high flood damage may constrain the available budget for costly climate protection, due to high recovery and reconstruction costs. We also suggest a number of psychological mechanisms that may play a role in explaining this non-linear effect, for example non-protective responses such as denial and fatalism if damage is high. When supporting private climate engagement, policymakers should not rely on a motivating effect of damage experience, but should acknowledge the economic and psychological limitations, especially of severely flood-affected households.},

We find that flood experience had a significant positive effect on the beliefs in the existence of climate change for those respondents living close to the flooded area. However, the effect decreases sharply with distance. We further show that this overall effect is driven by those respondents who already believed in climate change before the flood -- they saw their belief confirmed by their experience. In contrast, spatial proximity to the flood had no measurable effect on skeptics. These results imply that climate skeptics may not be influenced by the experience of natural disasters at their doorsteps.},

Simulations by Costello and Osborne (2005), for example, demonstrate how poorly some EFA analyses replicate, even with clear underlying factor structures and large samples. Thus, we argue that researchers should routinely examine the stability or volatility of their EFA solutions to gain more insight into the robustness of their solutions and insight into how to improve their instruments while still at the exploratory stage of development.

IPCC studies using different methods of event attribution have been assessed together, highlighting that these differences are smaller than the academic discourse on the methods suggests. This development raised two important research questions the science needs to answer: First, how do we formally combine attribution statements using highly conditional methods with probabilistic assessments of how climate change alters the likelihood and intensity of extreme weather events? Second, under what circumstances are individual attribution studies still necessary and to what extent do existing attribution studies provide enough information to answer societal questions? Furthermore, the scientific development still leaves important gaps, particularly in countries of the Global South, leading to ethical questions around the need and requirement of attribution of extreme events in policy contexts, informing adaptation and loss and damage and the role of vulnerability.},

Furthermore, environmentalists and individuals who consult more sources of news are less likely to have their attitudes toward global warming changed by current weather conditions.

To validate the method, we apply it to U.S. preelection polls for 1988 and 1992, poststratified by state, region, and the usual demographic variables. We evaluate the model by comparing it to state-level election outcomes. The multilevel model outperforms more commonly used models in political science. We envision the most important usage of this method to be not forecasting elections but estimating public opinion on a variety of issues at the state level.},

This study contributes to the literature by examining PTSD and depressive symptoms among 2,000 adolescents (50.9\% female, 70.5\% White) assessed after exposure to tornadoes in 2011. The authors hypothesized that greater tornado exposure, female sex, and younger age would be associated with distress, and that social support would interact with these associations. Analyses showed that PTSD symptoms were associated with lower levels of social support ({$\beta$} = -.28, p {$<$} .001), greater tornado exposure ({$\beta$} = .14, p {$<$} .001), lower household income ({$\beta$} = -.06, p = .013, female sex ({$\beta$} = -.10, p {$<$} .001), and older age ({$\beta$} = .07, p = .002), with a 3-way interaction between tornado exposure, sex, and social support ({$\beta$} = -.06, p = .017). For boys, the influence of tornado exposure on PTSD symptoms increased as social support decreased. Regardless of level of tornado exposure, low social support was related to PTSD symptoms for girls; depressive symptom results were similar. These findings were generally consistent with the literature and provide guidance for intervention development focused on strengthening social support at the individual, family, and community levels.},

In this paper we argue for and provide a more comprehensive set of considerations for gauging social impact following wildfires. These expanded considerations can advance methods for determining how social impacts from wildfire are changing over time and among diverse communities affected by fire. Our preliminary considerations for social impact from wildfire are drawn from the synthesis of the literature on wildfire and other hazards. We explain how our considerations cover existing research insights and advance them by accounting for wildfire-specific impacts. Considerations are presented as a series of questions that could be answered by an assemblage of outside professionals and local key informants in an affected area for comparison and policy purposes. Those considerations could also be used to advance research questions related to wildfire exposure and impact. We discuss multiple methodological strategies for collecting and analysing data that would be needed to answer considerations presented as part of this synthesis. This includes potential methods for using those considerations to assess social impact across communities.},

Less work has focused on how wildfire events affect the physical and psychological well-being of individual residents impacted by such events. In this study, we explore the extent to which personal- or community-level impacts, biophysical characteristics of a wildfire, and resident expectations about wildfire influence residents' self-reported well-being following such events. In fall 2013, we surveyed residents who were potentially impacted by 25 wildfires in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. Multivariate regression was used to determine the influences on wildfire impact to resident well-being, and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to test for variance in impacts to resident well-being across the 25 fires selected. The results suggest that a loss of connection to the landscape postfire, personal impacts such as damage to property, residents' expectations about wildfire impact in their locality, and disruption of resident routines were highly correlated with self-reported well-being after fires. Results of the HLM analysis suggest a high level of consistency in the relationships that influenced well-being across the 25 fires. Our findings indicate that common metrics could be used to help establish baselines for measuring impacts to well-being from fires.},

  abstract = {A growing body of research focuses on identifying patterns among human populations most at risk from hazards such as wildfire and the factors that help explain performance of mitigations that can help reduce that risk. Emerging policy surrounding wildfire management emphasizes the need to better understand such social vulnerability---or human populations' potential exposure to and sensitivity from wildfire-related impacts, including their ability to reduce negative impacts from the hazard. Studies of social vulnerability to wildfire often pair secondary demographic data with a variety of vegetation and wildfire simulation models to map potential risk. However, many of the assumptions made by those researchers about the demographic, spatial or perceptual factors that influence social vulnerability to wildfire have not been fully evaluated or tested against objective measures of potential wildfire risk. The research presented here utilizes self-reported surveys, GIS data, and wildfire simulations to test the relationships between select perceptual, demographic, and property characteristics of property owners against empirically simulated metrics for potential wildfire related damages or exposure. We also evaluate how those characteristics relate to property owners' performance of mitigations or support for fire management. Our results suggest that parcel characteristics provide the most significant explanation of variability in wildfire exposure, sensitivity and overall wildfire risk, while the positive relationship between income or property values and components of social vulnerability stands in contrast to typical assumptions from existing literature. Respondents' views about agency or government management helped explain a significant amount of variance in wildfire sensitivity, while the importance of wildfire risk in selecting a residence was an important influence on mitigation action. We use these and other results from our effort to discuss updated considerations for determining social vulnerability to wildfire and articulate alternative means to collect such information.},

Heat waves have had debilitating effects on human mortality, and global climate models predict an increase in the frequency and severity of heat waves. The extent to which climate change will harm human health through changes in the distribution of heat waves and the sources of uncertainty in estimating these effects have not been studied extensively. Objectives We estimated the future excess mortality attributable to heat waves under global climate change for a major U.S. city. Methods We used a database comprising daily data from 1987 through 2005 on mortality from all nonaccidental causes, ambient levels of particulate matter and ozone, temperature, and dew point temperature for the city of Chicago, Illinois. We estimated the associations between heat waves and mortality in Chicago using Poisson regression models. Results Under three different climate change scenarios for 2081--2100 and in the absence of adaptation, the city of Chicago could experience between 166 and 2,217 excess deaths per year attributable to heat waves, based on estimates from seven global climate models. We noted considerable variability in the projections of annual heat wave mortality; the largest source of variation was the choice of climate model. Conclusions The impact of future heat waves on human health will likely be profound, and significant gains can be expected by lowering future carbon dioxide emissions.},

Until now a comprehensive assessment of regional observed changes was hindered by~the range of metrics employed, underpinning datasets, and time periods examined. Here, using the Berkeley Earth temperature dataset and key heatwave metrics, we systematically examine regional and global observed heatwave trends. In almost all regions, heatwave frequency demonstrates the most rapid and significant change. A measure of cumulative heat shows significant increases almost everywhere since the 1950s, mainly driven by heatwave days. Trends in heatwave frequency, duration and cumulative heat have accelerated since the 1950s, and due to the high influence of variability we recommend regional trends are assessed over multiple decades. Our results provide comparable regional observed heatwave trends, on spatial and temporal scales necessary for understanding impacts.},

  abstract = {Investigations into the role of anthropogenic climate change in extreme weather events are now starting to extend into analysis of anthropogenic impacts on non-climate (e.g. socio-economic) systems. However, care needs to be taken when making this extension, because methodological choices regarding extreme weather attribution can become crucial when considering the events' impacts. The fraction of attributable risk (FAR) method, useful in extreme weather attribution research, has a very specific interpretation concerning a class of events, and there is potential to misinterpret results from weather event analyses as being applicable to specific events and their impact outcomes. Using two case studies of meteorological extremes and their impacts, we argue that FAR is not generally appropriate when estimating the magnitude of the anthropogenic signal behind a specific impact. Attribution assessments on impacts should always be carried out in addition to assessment of the associated meteorological event, since it cannot be assumed that the anthropogenic signal behind the weather is equivalent to the signal behind the impact because of lags and nonlinearities in the processes through which the impact system reacts to weather. Whilst there are situations where employing FAR to understand the climate change signal behind a class of impacts is useful (e.g. `system breaking' events), more useful results will generally be produced if attribution questions on specific impacts are reframed to focus on changes in the impact return value and magnitude across large samples of factual and counterfactual climate model and impact simulations. We advocate for constant interdisciplinary collaboration as essential for effective and robust impact attribution assessments.},

  abstract = {Abstract Despite their adverse impacts, definitions and measurements of heat waves are ambiguous and inconsistent, generally being endemic to only the group affected, or the respective study reporting the analysis. The present study addresses this issue by employing a set of three heat wave definitions, derived from surveying heat-related indices in the climate science literature. The definitions include three or more consecutive days above one of the following: the 90th percentile for maximum temperature, the 90th percentile for minimum temperature, and positive extreme heat factor (EHF) conditions. Additionally, each index is studied using a multiaspect framework measuring heat wave number, duration, participating days, and the peak and mean magnitudes. Observed climatologies and trends computed by Sen's Kendall slope estimator are presented for the Australian continent for two time periods (1951--2008 and 1971--2008). Trends in all aspects and definitions are smaller in magnitude but more significant for 1951--2008 than for 1971--2008. Considerable similarities exist in trends of the yearly number of days participating in a heat wave and yearly heat wave frequency, suggesting that the number of available heat wave days drives the number of events. Larger trends in the hottest part of a heat wave suggest that heat wave intensity is increasing faster than the mean magnitude. Although the direct results of this study cannot be inferred for other regions, the methodology has been designed as such that it is widely applicable. Furthermore, it includes a range of definitions that may be useful for a wide range of systems impacted by heat waves.},

Different approaches for dealing with missing responses exist, and there are no clear guidelines on which of those to use. While classical approaches rely on an ignorable missing data mechanism, the most recently developed model-based approaches account for nonignorable missing responses. Model-based approaches include the missing propensity in the measurement model. Although these models are very promising, the assumptions made in these models have not yet been tested for plausibility in empirical data. Furthermore, studies investigating the performance of different approaches have only focused on one kind of missing response at once. In this study, we investigated the performance of classical and model-based approaches in empirical data, accounting for different kinds of missing responses simultaneously. We confirmed the existence of a unidimensional tendency to omit items. Indicating nonignorability of the missing mechanism, missing tendency due to both omitted and not-reached items correlated with ability. However, results on parameter estimation showed that ignoring missing responses was sufficient to account for missing responses, and that the missing propensity was not needed in the model. The results from the empirical study were corroborated in a complete case simulation. {\copyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

The algorithm is based on random changes of elements of data matrices without changing the marginals; most powerful tests against all alternative hypotheses are given for which a monotone characteristic may be computed from the data matrix; alternatives may also be composed. Computation times are long, but exactp-values are approximated with the quality of approximation only depending on calculation time, but not on the number of persons. The power and the flexibility of the procedure is demonstrated by means of an empirical example where, among others, indicators for increased item similarities, the existence of subscales, violations of sufficiency of the raw score as well as learning processes were found. Many of the features described are implemented in the program T-Rasch 1.0 by Ponocny and Ponocny-Seliger (1999).},

  abstract = {Wildland fire in the South commands considerable attention, given the expanding wildland urban interface (WUI) across the region. Much of this growth is propelled by higher income retirees and others desiring natural amenity residential settings. However, population growth in the WUI increases the likelihood of wildfire fire ignition caused by people, as humans account for 93\% of all wildfires fires in the South. Coexisting with newly arrived, affluent WUI populations are working class, poor or otherwise socially vulnerable populations. The latter groups typically experience greater losses from environmental disasters such as wildfire because lower income residents are less likely to have established mitigation programs in place to help absorb loss. We use geographically weighted regression to examine spatial variation in the association between social vulnerability (SOVUL) and wildfire risk. In doing so, we identify ``hot spots'' or geographical clusters where SOVUL varies positively with wildfire risk across six Southern states---Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina. These clusters may or may not be located in the WUI. These hot spots are most prevalent in South Carolina and Florida. Identification of these population clusters can aid wildfire managers in deciding which communities to prioritize for mitigation programming.},

However, these MLM approaches do not accommodate mediation pathways with Level-2 outcomes and may produce conflated estimates of between- and within-level components of indirect effects. Moreover, these methods have each appeared in isolation, so a unified framework that integrates the existing methods, as well as new multilevel mediation models, is lacking. Here we show that a multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) paradigm can overcome these 2 limitations of mediation analysis with MLM. We present an integrative 2-level MSEM mathematical framework that subsumes new and existing multilevel mediation approaches as special cases. We use several applied examples and accompanying software code to illustrate the flexibility of this framework and to show that different substantive conclusions can be drawn using MSEM versus MLM.

Because of their increasing importance in informing the design of health products and services, it is critical to understand the extent to which DCEs give reliable predictions outside of the experimental context. We systematically reviewed the literature of published DCE studies comparing predictions to choices made in reality; we extracted individual-level data to estimate a bivariate mixed-effects model of pooled sensitivity and specificity. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria, and six of these gave sufficient data for inclusion in a meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates were 88\% (95\% CI 81, 92\%) and 34\% (95\% CI 23, 46\%), respectively, and the area under the SROC curve (AUC) was 0.60 (95\% CI 0.55, 0.64). Results indicate that DCEs can produce reasonable predictions of health-related behaviors. There is a great need for future research on the external validity of DCEs, particularly empirical studies assessing predicted and revealed preferences of a representative sample of participants.},

The present paper reviews i) the partially-saturated model fit approach first suggested by  and ii) an alternative model parameterization that removes the multilevel data structure. We next describe the implementation of an algorithm to compute partially-saturated model fit for 2-level structural equation models in the open source SEM package, OpenMx, including verification in a simulation study. Finally, an example empirical application evaluates leading theories on the structure of affect from ecological momentary assessment data collected thrice daily for two weeks from 345 participants.},

Multiple constructs are often of interest, and covariates are often multilevel (e.g., measured at the person and neighborhood level). Some item--level missing data can be expected. This paper proposes a multivariate, multilevel Rasch model with random effects for these purposes and illustrates its application to self--reports of criminal behavior. Under assumptions of conditional independence and additivity, the approach enables the investigator to calibrate the items and persons on an interval scale, assess reliability at the person and neighborhood levels, study the correlations among crime types at each level, assess the proportion of variation in each crime type that lies at each level, incorporate covariates at each level, and accommodate data missing at random. Using data on 20 item responses from 2842 adolescents ages 9 to 18 nested within 196 census tracts in Chicago, we illustrate how to test key assumptions, how to adjust the model in light of diagnostic analyses, and how to interpret parameter estimates.},

The most frequent applications of EFA among researchers consists of reducing relatively large sets of variables into more manageable ones, developing and refining a new instrument?s scales, and exploring relations among variables to build theory. Because researchers face a number of decisions when conducting EFA that can involve some subjectivity (e.g., factor extraction method, rotation), poor analytic decisions regarding how the EFA should be conducted (e.g., number of factors to extract) can produce misleading findings to the detriment of these efforts, especially theory building.The SolutionSteps must be taken to improve the quality of the decision making associated with conducting EFAs if sound theory building and research related to this statistical method is to continue. Higher quality EFAs facilitate higher quality theory building and research.The StakeholdersHRD theorists, researchers, and scholar-practitioners are the intended audience of this article. In particular, those interested in refining measures and theory building would benefit most from being exposed to best EFA decision-making practices.},

What human beings perceive as threat to their well-being and how they evaluate probabilities and magnitudes of unwanted consequences is codetermined by values, attitudes, social influences, and cultural identity. This article introduces the social amplification of risk framework (SARF) and applies it to climate change. The SARF is based on the thesis that events pertaining to hazards interact with psychological, social, institutional, and cultural processes in ways that can heighten or attenuate individual and social perceptions of risk and shape risk behavior. Drawing upon the concept of social amplification of risk, this article investigates the mechanisms of amplification and attenuation in the climate change debate: it focuses first on the micro-sociological and psychological literature on amplification and attenuation of individual responses (including behavior) in relation to climate change; and second on the application of functional resonance and common pool concepts to the intensity of societal concern and action, interpreted in the light of the SARF.

  abstract = {Individuals' direct exposure to and experience of climate change are arguably integral aspects of their risk perceptions, understandings, and engagement with the issue. Recent research investigating these experiences has thrown into sharp relief some fundamental considerations with respect to public risk perceptions and responses, in particular the extent to which such perceived encounters might reflect a priori beliefs and motivated reasoning. Findings to date are intriguing and compelling, both in regard to the escalating percentages of individuals who report having such personal encounters, and conclusions being drawn with respect to the nature, significance, and influence of such direct experience. These findings have also led to some intuitively reasonable but possibly problematic recommendations regarding policy and issue and behavioural engagement implications. A focus on underlying processes of experience and belief, oversimplified in terms of `seeing' or `believing', has however deflected attention from other issues such as the nature and contexts of individual climate change encounters, the clarity of the constructs and validity of the measures being used for `belief' and `experience', and the transactional and phenomenological nature of climate change encounters. There is nonetheless current and convergent evidence that perceived direct experience of environmental changes or events deemed to be manifestations of climate change influences psychological responses such as risk perception, acceptance, belief certainty, distress, and psychological and behavioural adaptation. These findings suggest that such experiences, for many, foster a contextualized and more personally meaningful realisation of what climate change portends, implies, and ultimately means, locally and globally.

  abstract = {A simulation study compared the performance of robust normal theory maximum likelihood (ML) and robust categorical least squares (cat-LS) methodology for estimating confirmatory factor analysis models with ordinal variables. Data were generated from 2 models with 2--7 categories, 4 sample sizes, 2 latent distributions, and 5 patterns of category thresholds. Results revealed that factor loadings and robust standard errors were generally most accurately estimated using cat-LS, especially with fewer than 5 categories; however, factor correlations and model fit were assessed equally well with ML. Cat-LS was found to be more sensitive to sample size and to violations of the assumption of normality of the underlying continuous variables. Normal theory ML was found to be more sensitive to asymmetric category thresholds and was especially biased when estimating large factor loadings. Accordingly, we recommend cat-LS for data sets containing variables with fewer than 5 categories and ML when there are 5 or more categories, sample size is small, and category thresholds are approximately symmetric. With 6 --7 categories, results were similar across methods for many conditions; in these cases, either method is acceptable.},

  abstract = {Environmental goods such as carbon abatement or green space development often generate benefit streams that may not occur until far into the future. How individual consumers value such amenities, therefore, depends critically on the discount rate. The usual assumption is that agents discount future values using constant, exponential rate, but there is some evidence from the lab suggesting that discount functions are more likely quasi-hyperbolic. We compare estimates of subjects' rate of intertemporal time preference for financial rewards and environmental goods using multiple price-list and a new matrix multiple price list approaches. Our objective is to determine if discount functions for environmental and monetary goods differ, and to estimate the structure of discounting in both contexts. We find that financial discount functions are not hyperbolic, but those for environmental goods are. Discount rates for environmental goods are generally lower than for financial rewards, but are still above zero. Consumers, therefore, value long-lived environmental goods differently than financial goods.},

As primary production drives Earth system biosphere functions, human appropriation of net primary production is proposed as a control variable for functional biosphere integrity.

Earth system modeling of different levels of the transgression of the climate and land system change boundaries illustrates that these anthropogenic impacts on Earth system must be considered in a systemic context.},

Overall, results suggest that the influence of temporal and spatial features of departure dates is moderated by participants' political orientation and geographic location. For instance, we observed some of the largest effects of our manipulation on the reported policy support of conservatives in the U.S. as compared to U.S. liberals and their counterparts in Singapore. We draw connections to relevant theory (e.g., construal level theory) and consider implications for climate departure dates as communication devices.},

In many instances, humans readily perceive feedback. In others, feedback is more difficult to perceive, so humans rely on experts, heuristics, biases, and/or identify confirming rationalities that may distort perceptions of feedback. This study explores human perception of feedback from natural systems by testing alternate conceptions about how individuals perceive climate anomalies, a form of feedback from the climate system. Results indicate that individuals generally perceive climate anomalies, especially when the anomalies are relatively extreme and persistent. Moreover, this finding is largely robust to political differences that generate predictable but small biases in feedback perception at extreme ends of the partisan spectrum. The subtlety of these biases bodes well for mitigation, adaptation, and resilience as human systems continue to interact with a changing climate system.},

This causes individuals to experience policy implementation as onerous. Based on a framework for administrative burden in citizen-state interactions, we test whether farmers' individual knowledge, psychological costs and compliance costs help to explain their perception of administrative burden related to direct payments. We refine this framework by testing different specifications of interrelations between psychological costs and perceived administrative burden based on findings from policy feedback theory and education research. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is applied to data collected from a representative sample of 808 Swiss farmers by postal questionnaire in 2019. We find that compliance costs and psychological costs contribute significantly to the perceived administrative burden. In contrast, farmers' knowledge level contributes to this perception not directly but indirectly, with higher knowledge reducing psychological costs. Our results support policy feedback theory, in that a high level of administrative burden increases psychological costs. Furthermore, well-educated and well-informed farmers show a more positive attitude toward agricultural policy and thus perceive administrative tasks as less onerous. Policy-makers should invest in the reduction of administrative requirements to reduce compliance costs.},

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate four empirical algorithms for creating such parcels, focusing on the effects of dimensionality on accuracy of parameter estimation and model fit. Results suggest that accuracy of parameter estimation is primarily a function of the nature and number of dimensions in a composite, and that greater dimensionality also renders parceling methods more similar with respect to accuracy of estimation. Conversely, model fit is predominantly influenced by the parceling algorithm and number of parcels formed. An integrative analysis of the degree to which model fit signals accuracy of estimation highlights the respective advantages and disadvantages of the parceling algorithms. Results suggest that a Radial parceling algorithm may offer advantages over Correlational, Factorial, or Random assignment of items to parcels. The behavior of the Radial algorithm, and iterative algorithms in general, warrant further investigation.},

Objective: the purpose of this article is to present the best practices and recent recommendations for a typical EFA in administration through a practical solution accessible to researchers. Methods: in this sense, in addition to discussing current practices versus recommended practices, a tutorial with real data on Factor is illustrated. The Factor software is still little known in the administration area, but is freeware, easy-to-use (point and click), and powerful. The step-by-step tutorial illustrated in the article, in addition to the discussions raised and an additional example, is also available in the format of tutorial videos. Conclusion: through the proposed didactic methodology (article-tutorial + video-tutorial), we encourage researchers/methodologists who have mastered a particular technique to do the same. Specifically about EFA, we hope that the presentation of the Factor software, as a first solution, can transcend the current outdated rules of thumb and heuristics, by making best practices accessible to administration researchers.},

To assess the cognitive and affective precursors of climate activism, we hypothesize and test a two-stage information-processing model based on social cognitive theory. In stage 1, expectations about climate change outcomes and perceived collective efficacy to mitigate the threat are hypothesized to influence affective issue involvement and support for societal mitigation action. In stage 2, beliefs about the effectiveness of political activism, perceived barriers to activist behaviors and opinion leadership are hypothesized to influence intended and actual activism. To test these hypotheses, we fit a structural equation model using nationally representative data. The model explains 52 percent of the variance in a latent variable representing three forms of climate change activism: contacting elected representatives; supporting organizations working on the issue; and attending climate change rallies or meetings. The results suggest that efforts to increase citizen activism should promote specific beliefs about climate change, build perceptions that political activism can be effective, and encourage interpersonal communication on the issue.},

This hypothesis undermines the basic premises of empirical research, which holds that nature hollows regular laws that may he studied through observations. A policy of not making adjustments for multiple comparisons is preferable because it will lead to fewer errors of interpretation when the data under evaluation are not random numbers but actual observations on nature.

Our objective was to quantify important environmental impacts of beef cattle production in the United States. Surveys and visits of farms, ranches and feedlots were conducted throughout seven regions (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Northern Plains, Southern Plains, Northwest and Southwest) to determine common practices and characteristics of cattle production. These data along with other information sources were used to create about 150 representative production systems throughout the country, which were simulated with the Integrated Farm System Model using local soil and climate data. The simulations quantified the performance and environmental impacts of beef cattle production systems for each region. A farm-gate life cycle assessment was used to quantify resource use and emissions for all production systems including traditional beef breeds and cull animals from the dairy industry. Regional and national totals were determined as the sum of the production system outputs multiplied by the number of cattle represented by each simulated system. The average annual greenhouse gas and reactive N emissions associated with beef cattle production over the past five years were determined to be 243\,{\textpm}\,26 Tg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) and 1760\,{\textpm}\,136 Gg N, respectively. Total fossil energy use was found to be 569\,{\textpm}\,53 PJ and blue water consumption was 23.2\,{\textpm}\,3.5 TL. Environmental intensities expressed per kg of carcass weight produced were 21.3\,{\textpm}\,2.3\,kg CO2e, 155\,{\textpm}\,12\,g\,N, 50.0\,{\textpm}\,4.7\,MJ, and 2034\,{\textpm}\,309\,L, respectively. These farm-gate values are being combined with post farm-gate sources of packing, processing, distribution, retail, consumption and waste handling to produce a full life cycle assessment of U.S. beef.

  abstract = {Previous research has shown a link between extreme weather events and people's beliefs about climate change and their pro-environmental behaviour. This indicates that people may become more environmentally friendly amid increasing extreme weather events. Still, the influence of experiencing extreme weather events on actual behaviour has rarely been tested with large-scale individual-level data and longitudinal methods. This study links panel data from 35,678 individuals to floods across England and heatwaves across the UK and applies within-person estimators to account for pre-existing differences between affected and unaffected individuals. Results reveal that individuals are more likely to believe in climate change after being affected by a geographically proximate flood or a temporally proximate heatwave. This association is stronger among initially right-leaning partisans and those initially more sceptic about the existence of climate change, thereby indicating attitudinal updating due to experiential learning. However, those exposed to extreme weather events do not change their environmental behaviour such as energy saving, sustainable shopping or mode of transportation. Even among those who are more likely to believe in climate change, people's behaviour does not react to extreme weather events.},

Following a qualitative study, we experimentally induce one of four frames of reference (identity, biodiversity conservation , economic prosperity, and climate change), and assess their effects on partici-pants' behavioral intentions using three scales (consumption-investment, consumption-reduction, and political participation). The sample (N 5 156) included people who thought climate change is natural and those who thought it is human-induced. Results show a significant impact of the identity frame, relative to the climate-change frame, for both consumption scales, in the total sample, and among those who reject the anthropogenic causes. These results offer a way to address behavioral resistances associated with antagonistic views on climate change. Despite a scientific consensus, many people in developed countries still reject or minimise the role of anthropogenic factors in causing climate change (e.g.},

To achieve these objectives, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on the impact of social norms on sustainability over the past 20 years, placing emphasis on the role of culture and self-construal. Altogether, we collected over 16,000 papers via Web of Science and subsequently used NVivo 12 for a fine-grained qualitative analysis. Our findings provide several new insights. First, we identified the most popular research areas, top journals and leading authors in the field of social norms and pro-environmental sustainability. Second, we pinpointed the most popular research topics in the context of the norm--sustainability relationship. Third, we revealed how culture and self-construal have been addressed when researching the connection between social norms and pro-environmental behavior, identified managerial implications, and offered future research directions on the moderating effects of culture and self-construal.},

We discuss the latent moderated structural equation procedure (LMS) approach to specifying latent variable interactions, which is implemented in Mplus, and offer a simple and accessible way of testing combined moderation and mediation hypotheses using SEM. To do so, we provide sample code for six commonly encountered moderation and mediation cases and relevant equations that can be easily adapted to researchers' data. By articulating the similarities in the two different approaches, discussing the combination of moderation and mediation, we also contribute to the research methods literature.},

  abstract = {Droughts are anticipated to intensify in many parts of the world due to climate change. However, the issue of drought definition, namely the diversity of drought indices, makes it difficult to compare drought assessments. This issue is widely known, but its relative importance has never been quantitatively evaluated in comparison to other sources of uncertainty. Here, encompassing three drought categories (meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological droughts) with four temporal scales of interest, we evaluated changes in the drought frequency using multi-model and multi-scenario simulations to identify areas where the definition issue could result in pronounced uncertainties and to what extent. We investigated the disagreement in the signs of changes between drought definitions and decomposed the variance into four main factors: drought definitions, greenhouse gas concentration scenarios, global climate models, and global water models, as well as their interactions. The results show that models were the primary sources of variance over 82\% of the global land area. On the other hand, the drought definition was the dominant source of variance in the remaining 17\%, especially in parts of northern high-latitudes. Our results highlight specific regions where differences in drought definitions result in a large spread among projections, including areas showing opposite signs of significant changes. At a global scale, 7\% of the variance resulted independently from the definition issue, and that value increased to 44\% when 1st and 2nd order interactions were considered. The quantitative results suggest that by clarifying hydrological processes or sectors of interest, one could avoid these uncertainties in drought assessments to obtain a clearer picture of future drought change.},

Muth{\'e}n (1993) proposed corrections to accompany certain categorical data estimators, such as cat-LS or cat-DWLS. Other applications of robust corrections exist. Despite the diversity of applications, all robust corrections are constructed using the same underlying rationale: They correct for inefficiency of the chosen estimator. The goal of this article is to make the formulas behind all types of robust corrections more intuitive. This is accomplished by building an analogy with similar equations in linear regression and then by reformulating the SEM model as a nonlinear regression model.},

However, when predictors are modeled as latent variables, estimating and testing interactions requires additional steps beyond the models used for regression. We review methods of estimating and testing latent variable interactions with a focus on product indicator methods. Product indicator methods of examining latent interactions provide an accurate method to estimate and test latent interactions and can be implemented in any latent variable modeling software package. Significant latent interactions require additional steps (plotting and probing) to interpret interaction effects. We demonstrate how these methods can be easily implemented using functions in the semTools package with models fit using the lavaan package in R, and we illustrate how these methods work using an applied example concerning teacher stress and testing.},

U.S. participants completed a visual-spatial task that portrayed the Maldives---a remote island nation facing severe climate impacts---as relatively proximal or distal, before judging the nation's geographic distance (Studies 1 and 2) and summarizing a video depicting its climate vulnerabilities (Study 2). Suggesting an effect on psychological distance, participants in the proximal condition judged the Maldives as geographically closer and described its climate impacts using more concrete (vs. abstract) language. However, this reduced psychological distance did not translate into increased policy support.

Results from multilevel modeling analyses showed that spatial bias was greater for happier and younger individuals and for those from smaller communities. We interpret these results as evidence for self-serving and ``place-serving'' biases in which the bias tempers the severity of environmental problems in one's local area.

Justification of study size is hardly provided, especially when a Rasch model is planned for analysing the data in a 2-group comparison study. The classical sample size formula (CLASSIC) for comparing normally distributed endpoints between two groups has shown to be inadequate in this setting (underestimated study sizes). A correction factor (RATIO) has been proposed to reach an adequate sample size from the CLASSIC when a Rasch model is intended to be used for analysis. The objective was to explore the impact of the parameters used for study design on the RATIO and to identify the most relevant to provide a simple method for sample size determination for Rasch modelling. Methods: A large combination of parameters used for study design was simulated using a Monte Carlo method: variance of the latent trait, group effect, sample size per group, number of items and items difficulty parameters. A linear regression model explaining the RATIO and including all the former parameters as covariates was fitted. Results: The most relevant parameters explaining the ratio's variations were the number of items and the variance of the latent trait (R 2 = 99.4\%).},

Objectives Heat and air pollution advisory systems are in place in many cities for early detection and response to reduce health consequences, or severity of adverse conditions. Whereas the ability to forecast heat waves and/or air pollution episodes has become increasingly sophisticated and accurate, little is known about the effectiveness of advisories in altering public behavior. Methods Air quality and meteorological conditions were measured during advisory and control days in Portland, OR and Houston, TX in 2005 and 2006 and 1962 subjects were interviewed by telephone about their perception and response to these conditions. Results Elevated ambient temperatures were accurately recognized regardless of air conditioning use; in Portland, respondents resorted to active cooling behavior (AC, fan, etc.), while in Houston no such change was observed. More heat-related symptoms were reported in Portland compared to Houston, probably due to low air conditioning use in the northwest. One-third of study participants were aware of air quality advisories but only {$\sim$}10--15\% claimed to have changed activities during such an episode. Not the advisory, however, drove their behavior change, but rather the perception of poor air quality, which was not related to PM2.5 or ozone measurements. Conclusions Messages are not reaching the public during potentially hazardous weather and air quality conditions. Climatic forecasts are increasingly predictive but public agencies fail to mount an appropriate outreach response.},

Beliefs about global warming are found to play a dominant role in determining the perception of local weather. Specifically, people who view that global warming is causing an immediate impact, is serious, and needs to be a priority are much more likely to perceive a strange pattern of weather in the recent past. This finding conforms to motivated reasoning which refers to the tendency to interpret evidence to confirm the preexisting beliefs and predisposition. Among all the weather measures, the total number of extreme weather events in the past three years appears to be the only significant indicator of perceived weather. Specifically, individuals who have experienced more extreme weather events in their home counties are more likely than those elsewhere to perceive the weather is stranger than usual. I further examine how actual weather and perceived weather together affect perceptions of global warming. The results illustrate that the perception of local weather has stronger explanatory power than actual weather. People who perceive the strange weather patterns are much more likely than others to see the immediate impacts and priority of global warming. Future studies are needed to investigate the dynamic relationship between perceptions of global warming and perceptions of weather and climate. In addition, more studies are needed to further examine how the public forms their opinions toward various specific types of the local weather and climate.},

Numerous empirical studies of the past two decades have identified the politicization of this issue. In recent years, the concurrence of rising extreme weather events and uptick in public concern for climate change has led to common speculation that the former may drive up the latter. Using a nationally representative survey dataset combined with climate extremes data including extreme heat, extreme precipitation, and mild drought or worse, we use Structural Equation Modeling to examine how politics and climate extremes altogether shape American public concern for climate change. In addition to confirming politicization of climate change, we find that approval of President Trump not only promotes skeptical climate change perceptions but also serves as an intervening amplifier of these perceptions for Republicans and conservatives. Thus, one's concern for climate change is partially explained by their political identification and partially explained by their levels of approval of Trump. With the 2020 presidential election underway, it remains to be seen how attitudes towards presidential candidates can affect climate change perceptions and support for climate policies. The widely speculated role of climate extremes however fails to show significant effects in views towards climate change. We provide explanations for this insignificant finding. The study ends by calling for more studies to further investigate the drivers of formation of opinions towards climate change.},

Data were obtained from mail surveys on wolves and wolf management given to Grand Teton National Park visitors and Greater Yellowstone Area residents. Cronbach's alpha was calculated on the survey questions regarding emotions about wolves for park visitors and local residents merged and each segment individually. Confirmatory factor analysis was also conducted on each segment. Beyond demonstrating the importance of confirmatroy factor analysis in scale development, results suggest that segmentation is an important consideration.

Using structural equation modeling (SEM) to determine the chain of causation from CHRP to PEB among hospital workers. The result shows that CHRP positively affects PEA and PEI, and PEI positively affects their PEB. In addition, although CHRP has no significant direct effect on PEB, it can play a crucial indirect effect through the mediating role of PEI. Moreover, the result of multiple regression shows that there are significant differences regarding PEA, PEI, and PEB.},

This is a nontrivial statistical problem because climate change effects have to be extracted from ``noisy'' weather data within a limited time range. We use nonparametric Bayesian methods to estimate the trends of extreme events that have occurred between 1979 and 2019, based on data for temperature and rainfall. We focus on 100-y events for each month in  1{$^\circ\times$}1{$^\circ$}  geographical areas looking at hourly temperature and 5-d cumulative rainfall. Distribution tail models are constructed using extreme value theory (EVT) and data on 33-y events. This work shows it is possible to aggregate data from spatial points in diverse climate zones for a given month and fit an EVT model with the same parameters. This surprising result means there are enough extreme event data to see the trends in the 41-y record for each calendar month. The yearly trends of the risk of a 100-y high-temperature event show an average 2.1-fold increase over the last 41 y of data across all months, with a 2.6-fold increase for the months of July through October. The risk of high rainfall extremes increases in December and January 1.4-fold, but declines by 22\% for the spring and summer months.},

EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA studies assess particular events in subjects' lives or assess subjects at periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological sensors. We discuss the rationale for EMA, EMA designs, methodological and practical issues, and comparisons of EMA and recall data.

This lag may be caused, in part, by the psychological distance between decision-makers today and those who will likely experience the worst impacts of climate change in the future. This psychological distance reduces the salience of those impacts in today's decisions. In a randomized control experiment using a letter-to-the-future treatment and a climate change essay treatment, I find that compared to a control group, both writing tasks that focus attention on the future risks of climate change increase the willingness to donate to climate change mitigation efforts. I also find evidence that for parents and grandparents, writing a letter to one's child or grandchild increases the salience of existing concerns about how climate change may impact one's children.

Several studies, in recent times, have brought to light the adverse public mental health outcomes of extreme weather events for the suffering communities. The general public and the policy making bodies need to gain awareness about these impacts. Through such awareness, communities and their governments can institutionalize mechanisms to provide psychological support to the populations affected by climate change, before it becomes a massive public health challenge and starts affecting the social and vocational lives of people. There is an urgent need for addressing these impacts. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the deleterious effects of climate change related extreme weather events on mental health, the worldwide response of several communities to such events, and preparedness of the public and government to deal with these adverse mental health impacts. Policy imperatives to prevent and mitigate these impacts have been suggested. It is hoped that the psychologists, governments, and communities will act earnestly to prevent the impending harm to human mental health due to climate change.},

To effectively mitigate climate change by reforming human consumption patterns we must have a comprehensive understanding of the linkages between consumption and climate change and how consumption may be altered. This article begins by reviewing the empirical research that links consumption and GHG emissions and identifies GHG-intensive actions and systems. We then identify four social science understandings of consumption: the consumer as homo economicus, the predictably irrational consumer, the locked-in consumer, and the socially organized consumer. These understandings of consumption that emerge from economics, psychology, anthropology, and sociology lead us to different conclusions on what can be done to change consumption patterns to mitigate climate change. To effectively transform consumption, we advocate the implementation of a range of policy solutions and explore several levers for managing change.

This study tested the hypothesis that people without flooding experience underestimate the negative affect evoked by such an event. People who were affected by a severe recent flood disaster were compared with people who were not affected, but who also lived in flood-prone areas. Face-to-face interviews with open and closed questions were conducted (n= 201). Results suggest that people without flood experience envisaged the consequences of a flood differently from people who had actually experienced severe losses due to a flood. People who were not affected strongly underestimated the negative affect associated with a flood. Based on the results, it can be concluded that risk communication must not focus solely on technical aspects; in order to trigger motivation for mitigation behavior, successful communication must also help people to envisage the negative emotional consequences of natural disasters.},

First, alpha always has a value, which cannot be equal to the test score's reliability given the interitem covariance matrix and the usual assumptions about measurement error. Second, in practice, alpha is used more often as a measure of the test's internal consistency than as an estimate of reliability. However, it can be shown easily that alpha is unrelated to the internal structure of the test. It is further discussed that statistics based on a single test administration do not convey much information about the accuracy of individuals' test performance. The paper ends with a list of conclusions about the usefulness of alpha.},

  abstract = {Science communication has been historically predicated on the knowledge deficit model. Yet, empirical research has shown that public communication of science is more complex than what the knowledge deficit model suggests. In this essay, we pose four lines of reasoning and present empirical data for why we believe the deficit model still persists in public communication of science. First, we posit that scientists' training results in the belief that public audiences can and do process information in a rational manner. Second, the persistence of this model may be a product of current institutional structures. Many graduate education programs in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields generally lack formal training in public communication. We offer empirical evidence that demonstrates that scientists who have less positive attitudes toward the social sciences are more likely to adhere to the knowledge deficit model of science communication. Third, we present empirical evidence of how scientists conceptualize ``the public'' and link this to attitudes toward the deficit model. We find that perceiving a knowledge deficit in the public is closely tied to scientists' perceptions of the individuals who comprise the public. Finally, we argue that the knowledge deficit model is perpetuated because it can easily influence public policy for science issues. We propose some ways to uproot the deficit model and move toward more effective science communication efforts, which include training scientists in communication methods grounded in social science research and using approaches that engage community members around scientific issues.},

However, individuals may fail to act because they perceive climate change as a threat that is distant or not personally relevant, or believe their actions are not impactful. To address these psychological barriers, we conducted a large-scale ``intervention tournament.'' In a sample of 7,624 participants, we systematically tested 17 interventions that targeted psychological mechanisms described by three key themes: Relevance, Future Thinking, and Response Efficacy. Interventions that emphasized social relevance were the most effective for motivating people to share news articles and petitions about climate change. Interventions that targeted future thinking were the most effective for broadly motivating individual actions (e.g., driving less, eating vegetarian meals) and collective actions (e.g., donating, volunteering) to address climate change. Interventions that emphasized the environmental impact of these actions reliably increased the perceived impact of pro-environmental actions, but did not consistently motivate action. Notably, interventions that targeted two or more mechanisms---such as imagining a future scenario that involved oneself or close others---were most effective. Importantly, our leading interventions were substantially more effective than prevalent existing strategies (e.g., carbon footprint information). Our findings are relevant to theories of behavior change, motivation, and information sharing, with potential applications across domains. Insights from our tournament could be applied to develop scalable online interventions and mass communication campaigns to address climate change.},

Results of a survey of the U.S. public (n=653) indicates that individuals who believe climate change impacts are unlikely to happen or will primarily affect other people in other places are less likely to be concerned about climate change impacts and less likely to support climate adaptation. However, an individual's support for climate change adaptation measures is not influenced by their perception of when climate change impacts will occur even when taking into account concern for climate impacts. Critical for policy-makers, a belief that climate adaptation measures will not be effective attenuates the relationship between psychological distance, concern for climate change impacts, and adaptation policy measures. Our results indicate that to effectively communicate about climate change, policy-makers should emphasize that: (i) climate change impacts are occurring, (ii) that their constituents are being affected now, or will be in the future, and (iii) communicate that adaptation measures can be effective in addressing risks associated with climate change impacts.},

One di¤culty of using responsibility feelings as a predictor is that people can feel either morally or conventionally responsible. Moral responsibility feelings depend on a person's self-ascribed responsibility (i.e. a deliberate responsibility judgement) and guilt feelings. Conventional responsibility feelings depend on the social expectations a person is aware of and his or her readiness to ful¢ll these expectations. In a survey study of 445 members of two Swiss transportation associations, the relative in{\pounds}uence of these distinguishable responsibility concepts on ecological behaviour was assessed. Structural equation analyses revealed that people apparently feel morally responsible rather than conventionally responsible for the environment. Guilt feelings explain 44 per cent of the variance of these responsibility feelings, which, in turn, explain 45 per cent of the variance of a person's deliberately made responsibility judgement , which, in turn, predicts 55 per cent of the variance of a person's ecological behaviour. These results suggest that if people feel guilty for what they do or fail to do, they also feel morally responsible for the environment.This promotes their self-ascription of responsibility and it is this judgement that predicts a considerable portion of a person's ecological behaviour.},

The normative theory is concerned with prescribing courses of action that conform most closely to the decision maker's beliefs and values. Describing these beliefs and values and the manner in which individuals incorporate them into their decisions is the aim of descriptive decision theory. This review is organized around these two facets. The first section deals with descriptive studies of judgment, inference, and choice; the second section discusses the development of decision-aiding techniques. As we reviewed the literature, several trends caught our attention. One is that decision making is being studied by researchers from an increasingly diverse set of disciplines, including medicine, economics, education, political science, geography, engineering, marketing, and management science, as well as psychology. Neverthe\- less, the importance of psychological concepts is increasing, in both the normative and descriptive work. Whereas past descriptive studies consisted mainly of rather superfi cial comparisons between actual behavior and normative models, research now focuses on the psychological underpinnings of observed behavior. Likewise. the prescriptive enterprise is being psychologized by challenges to the acceptability of the fundamental axioms of utility theory (140, 188, 256). IThis is the fourth survey of this topic to appear in the Annual Review of Psychology. Its predecessors were articles by Edwards (78). Becker \& McClintock (24). and Rapoport \& Wallsten (226).

Sometimes they result from the vagaries of nature, as in the case of flood, earthquake, or storm, and thus are truly the outcomes of "games against nature." In other cases they follow technological failure or unintentional human error, as in the case of Chernobyl or Bhopal, putting them also into the category of risks that are predictable only probabilistically. More recently we have witnessed another form of extreme hazard, resulting from terrorism. One of us has termed this "a new species of trouble" (Slovic, in press), since it involves an intelligent and motivated opponent, putting the situations that give rise to these types of extreme events into the domain of economic game theory. The purpose of this brief review is to examine what existing research can tell us about the perception of risk associated with these extreme events.

Previous research on educational data has demonstrated that Rasch fit statistics (mean squares and t-statistics) are highly susceptible to sample size variation for dichotomously scored rating data, although little is known about this relationship for polytomous data. These statistics help inform researchers about how well items fit to a unidimensional latent trait, and are an important adjunct to modern psychometrics. Given the increasing use of Rasch models in health research the purpose of this study was therefore to explore the relationship between fit statistics and sample size for polytomous data. Methods. Data were collated from a heterogeneous sample of cancer patients (n = 4072) who had completed both the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Ten samples were drawn with replacement for each of eight sample sizes (n = 25 to n = 3200). The Rating and Partial Credit Models were applied and the mean square and t-fit statistics (infit/outfit) derived for each model. Results. The results demonstrated that t-statistics were highly sensitive to sample size, whereas mean square statistics remained relatively stable for polytomous data. Conclusion. It was concluded that mean square statistics were relatively independent of sample size for polytomous data and that misfit to the model could be identified using published recommended ranges. {\copyright} 2008 Smith et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

An undergraduate sample (N\,=\,475) completed an online survey of Big Five personality, political attitudes, place attachment, and participation in ERB. Correlation analyses suggested that openness to new experiences, liberal attitudes, and place identity had reliable, statistically significant relations with ERB. The moderated mediation analyses provided support for the synergistic model. Specifically, openness' effect on the adoption of ERB was mediated by liberal attitudes and this mediation effect was further moderated by place identity. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.},

This experimental study seeks to investigate how transferable existing research findings on framing from health and behavioural research are to the climate change case. The study (N=161) examined how framing the same information about climate change in terms of gain or loss outcomes and in terms of local or distant impacts can affect perceptions. Text on potential climate change impacts was adapted from the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, alongside maps and images of potential flooding impacts. Participants then completed measures of various relevant socio-cognitive factors and questions assessing their responses to the information that they had received. Results indicated that, ceteris paribus, gain frames were superior to loss frames in increasing positive attitudes towards climate change mitigation, and also increased the perceived severity of climate change impacts. However, third variable analyses demonstrated that the superiority of the gain frame was partially suppressed by lower fear responses and poorer information recall within gain framed information. In addition, framing climate change impacts as distant (whilst keeping information presented the same) resulted in climate change impacts being perceived as more severe, whilst attitudes towards climate change mitigation were more positive when participants were asked to consider social rather than personal aspects of climate change. Implications for designing communications about climate change are outlined.},

  abstract = {Avoiding dangerous climate change is one of the most urgent social risk issues we face today and understanding related public perceptions is critical to engaging the public with the major societal transformations required to combat climate change. Analyses of public perceptions have indicated that climate change is perceived as distant on a number of different dimensions. However, to date there has been no in-depth exploration of the psychological distance of climate change. This study uses a nationally representative British sample in order to systematically explore and characterize each of the four theorized dimensions of psychological distance---temporal, social, and geographical distance, and uncertainty---in relation to climate change. We examine how each of these different aspects of psychological distance relate to each other as well as to concerns about climate change and sustainable behavior intentions. Results indicate that climate change is both psychologically distant and proximal in relation to different dimensions. Lower psychological distance was generally associated with higher levels of concern, although perceived impacts on developing countries, as an indicator of social distance, was also significantly related to preparedness to act on climate change. Our findings clearly point to the utility of risk communication techniques designed to reduce psychological distance. However, highlighting the potentially very serious distant impacts of climate change may also be useful in promoting sustainable behavior, even among those already concerned.},

We aimed to replicate this temporal framing effect and extend on research in this area by testing the potential drivers of the effect. Across two large-scale replication studies, we found limited evidence that past comparisons (relative to future comparisons) increase pro-environmentalism among those with a more conservative political ideology, thus precluding a full investigation into the mediators of the effect. Where the effect was present, it was not consistent across studies. In Study One, conservatives reported greater certainty that climate change was real after viewing past comparisons, as the environmental changes were perceived as more certain. However, in Study Two, the temporal framing condition interacted with political orientation to instead undermine the certainty about climate change among political liberals in the past-focused condition. Together, these studies present the first evidence of backfire from temporal frames, and do not support the efficacy of past comparisons for increasing conservatives' environmentalism. We echo recent calls for open science principles, including preregistration and efforts to replicate existing work, and suggest the replication of other methods of inducing temporal comparisons.},

  abstract = {In the social sciences, factor analysis is a widely used tool to identify latent constructs underlying task performance or the answers to questionnaire items. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is a data-driven approach to factor analysis and is used to extract a smaller number of common factors that represent or explain the common variance of a larger set of manifest variables (see, e.g., Watkins, 2018 for an overview). Several decisions have to be made in advance when performing an EFA, including the number of factors to extract, and the extraction and rotation method to be used. After a factor solution has been found, it is useful to subject the resulting factor solution to an orthogonalization procedure to achieve a hierarchical factor solution with one general and several specific factors. This situation especially applies to data structures in the field of intelligence research where usually high, positive factor intercorrelations occur. From this orthogonalized, hierarchical solution, the variance can then be partitioned to estimate the relative importance of the general versus the specific factors using omega reliability coefficients (e.g., McDonald, 1999).},

  abstract = {Interaction effects between explanatory constructs are an important part of many social theories. Analyses of interaction effects between variables using regression techniques have low power because they do not control for measurement errors. Therefore, latent interaction modeling using structural equation modeling (SEM) has been proposed as a better alternative to test for interaction effects. In contrast to traditional and complicated `constrained' SEM approaches, two recent developments, the unconstrained approach and the residual centering approach, are especially attractive for applied researchers as they are much easier to implement. However, applied researchers still seem to be unsure about how to apply these approaches. In this study, we illustrate the use of the unconstrained and the residual centering approach and compare these approaches with the constrained approach of Algina and Moulder (2001) using data from a field study of 1,442 students. Theoretical background is the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991) in which we test the proposed interaction between an individual's intention to perform a behavior and perceived behavioral control (PBC) on behavior. The illustration should assist researchers interested in testing interaction effects using structural equation modeling.},

We found that the NEP is indistinguishable from a scale of awareness of consequences (AC) of general environmental conditions, both psychometrically and in terms of its relations to behavioral intentions, but somewhat different in its relations to basic value orientations and sociodemographic variables. We conclude that both NEP and AC measure generalized beliefs about the nature of human-environment interactions-or "folk ecology"---a set of beliefs that may be influenced by social structure and values and that influence attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral intentions regarding specific environmental conditions.},

The results of other analyses reveal that the WxSQ possesses acceptable psychometric properties (Cronbach's {$\alpha$} = 0.83, test-retest reliability coefficient of 0.91). Weather salience was related to the ownership and use of a thermometer and also to being able to correctly distinguish between weather watches and warnings. Differences in weather salience scores also were observed, especially for men, between those students who had (versus had not) evacuated because of a hurricane and between those who had (versus had not) experienced weather-related property damages. The limitations of the study due to the use of an undergraduate sample are discussed along with some possible applications of the WxSQ.},

  abstract = {A variety of statistical methods have been suggested for detecting differential item functioning (DIF) in the Rasch model. Most of these methods are designed for the comparison of pre-specified focal and reference groups, such as males and females. Latent class approaches, on the other hand, allow the detection of previously unknown groups exhibiting DIF. However, this approach provides no straightforward interpretation of the groups with respect to person characteristics. Here, we propose a new method for DIF detection based on model-based recursive partitioning that can be considered as a compromise between those two extremes. With this approach it is possible to detect groups of subjects exhibiting DIF, which are not pre-specified, but result from combinations of observed covariates. These groups are directly in-terpretable and can thus help generate hypotheses about the psychological sources of DIF. The statistical background and construction of the new method are introduced by means of an instructive example, and extensive simulation studies are presented to support and illustrate the statistical properties of the method, which is then applied to empirical data from a general knowledge quiz. A software implementation of the method is freely available in the R system for statistical computing.},

In the current investigation, we examined whether both of these constructs independently relate to proenvironmental behaviors. We then tested the efficacy of a set of related interventions targeting each of these two mechanisms independently. Participants (n~=~661) either wrote a letter to their child in the future or wrote a climate essay detailing the threats of climate change. In both conditions (relative to a control condition), participants reported feeling a greater responsibility to reduce climate change and stronger intentions to engage in proenvironmental behaviors. However, only participants who wrote a letter to their child in the future reported increased legacy motivation and chose to have a greater part of their bonus donated to a proenvironmental charity. Increased legacy motivation (for the letter condition) and perceptions of responsibility to reduce climate change (for the letter and climate essay conditions) explained (i.e., mediated) part of the treatment effects on these outcomes. However, a week later, participants across both conditions did not differ in their self-reports of actual proenvironmental behavior engagement suggesting that stronger and more frequent intervention is required to produce sustained effects over time.},

Cronbach's alpha is regularly adopted in studies in science education: it was referred to in 69 different papers published in 4 leading science education journals in a single year (2015)---usually as a measure of reliability. This article explores how this statistic is used in reporting science education research and what it represents. Authors often cite alpha values with little commentary to explain why they feel this statistic is relevant and seldom interpret the result for readers beyond citing an arbitrary threshold for an acceptable value. Those authors who do offer readers qualitative descriptors interpreting alpha values adopt a diverse and seemingly arbitrary terminology. More seriously, illustrative examples from the science education literature demonstrate that alpha may be acceptable even when there are recognised problems with the scales concerned. Alpha is also sometimes inappropriately used to claim an instrument is unidimensional. It is argued that a high value of alpha offers limited evidence of the reliability of a research instrument, and that indeed a very high value may actually be undesirable when developing a test of scientific knowledge or understanding. Guidance is offered to authors reporting, and readers evaluating, studies that present Cronbach's alpha statistic as evidence of instrument quality.},

They have the desirable properties of being able to handle mixed types of missing data, they are adaptive to interactions and nonlinearity, and they have the potential to scale to big data settings. Currently there are many different RF imputation algorithms, but relatively little guidance about their efficacy. Using a large, diverse collection of data sets, imputation performance of various RF algorithms was assessed under different missing data mechanisms. Algorithms included proximity imputation, on the fly imputation, and imputation utilizing multivariate unsupervised and supervised splitting---the latter class representing a generalization of a new promising imputation algorithm called missForest. Our findings reveal RF imputation to be generally robust with performance improving with increasing correlation. Performance was good under moderate to high missingness, and even (in certain cases) when data was missing not at random.},

Given their increasing frequency, there is a debate about how to address these wildfires with significant social impacts, but there is no agreement upon terminology to describe them. The concept of extreme wildfire event (EWE) has emerged to bring some coherence on this kind of events. It is increasingly used, often as a synonym of other terms related to wildfires of high intensity and size, but its definition remains elusive. The goal of this paper is to go beyond drawing on distinct disciplinary perspectives to develop a holistic view of EWE as a social-ecological phenomenon. Based on literature review and using a transdisciplinary approach, this paper proposes a definition of EWE as a process and an outcome. Considering the lack of a consistent ``scale of gravity'' to leverage extreme wildfire events such as in natural hazards (e.g., tornados, hurricanes and earthquakes) we present a proposal of wildfire classification with seven categories based on measurable fire spread and behavior parameters and suppression difficulty. The categories 5 to 7 are labeled as EWE.},

Characteristics of the studies were compared to gain more insight into the practice of scale analysis. Findings indicate that FA is applied far more often than IRT. Many times it is unclear whether the data justify the chosen method because model assumptions are neglected. We recommended that researchers (a) use substantive knowledge about the items to their advantage by more frequently employing confirmatory techniques, as well as adding item content and interpretability of factors to the criteria in model evaluation; and (b) investigate model assumptions and report corresponding findings. To this end, we recommend more collaboration between substantive researchers and statisticians/psychometricians.},

My research in the field now known as behavioral economics started from real life stories I observed while I was a graduate student at the University of Rochester. Economists often sneer at "anecdotal data" and I had less than that-a collection of anecdotes without a hint of data. Yet, each story captured something about human behavior that seemed inconsistent with the economic theory I was struggling to master in graduate school. Here are a few examples: {$\bullet$} At a dinner party for fellow economics graduate students I put out a large bowl of cashew nuts to accompany drinks while waiting for dinner to finish cooking. In a short period of time, we devoured half the bowl of nuts. Seeing that our appetites (and waistlines) were in danger I removed the bowl and left it in the kitchen pantry. When I returned everyone thanked me. But, as economists are prone to do, we soon launched into analysis: how is it that we were all happy now that the nuts were gone? A basic axiom of economic theory is that more choices are always preferred to fewer-because you can always turn down the extra option. {$\bullet$} The chair of the University of Rochester economics department (and one of my advisors), Richard Rosett was a wine lover who had begun buying and collecting wine in the 1950s. For as little as \$5, he had purchased some choice bottles that he could now sell to a local retailer for \$100. Rosett had a rule against paying more than \$30 for a bottle of wine, but he did not sell any of his old bottles. Instead he would drink them on special occasions. In summary, he would enjoy his old bottles worth \$100 each, but he would neither buy nor sell at that price. Therefore his utility of one of those old bottles was both higher and lower than \$100. Impossible. {$\bullet$} My friend Jeffrey and I were given two tickets to a professional basketball game in Buffalo, normally a 75-minute drive from Rochester. On the day of the game},

Among them are the ␹2 goodness-of-fit test, decomposition of the ␹2, derived measures like the popular root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) or comparative fit index (CFI), or inspection of residuals or modification indices. Many of these methods provide a global approach to model fit evaluation: A single index is computed that quantifies the fit of the entire SEM to the data. In contrast, graphical criteria like d-separation or trek-separation allow derivation of implications that can be used for local fit evaluation, an approach that is hardly ever applied. We provide an overview of local fit evaluation from the viewpoint of SEM practitioners. In the presence of model misfit, local fit evaluation can potentially help in pinpointing where the problem with the model lies. For models that do fit the data, local tests can identify the parts of the model that are corroborated by the data. Local tests can also be conducted before a model is fitted at all, and they can be used even for models that are globally underidentified. We discuss appropriate statistical local tests, and provide applied examples. We also present novel software in R that automates this type of local fit evaluation.},

It reflects on the recent history of dry recycling (i.e. recycling of `dry' materials such as paper, glass, plastics and cans) and asks the question as to what influence policy drivers and the increased provision of facilities for recycling have had on people's behaviour. In reviewing the evidence for recycling being considered a norm, this paper explores what influence norms, habit and identities have on recycling behaviour. It then considers what lessons the evidence offers for using the normalisation of recycling behaviour in influencing more people to recycle and to adopt other sustainable behaviours. The somewhat contentious issue of whether engaging in recycling behaviours has a positive or negative effect on people engaging with other pro-environmental behaviours is discussed. The evidence shows that both positive and negative spillover occurs and understanding where the balance lies, as well as what effect recycling being a norm plays in this, is important in determining appropriate interventions to influence pro-environmental behaviours. The paper concludes with some observations on implications of the evidence on intervention approaches to influence pro-environmental behaviours.},

  abstract = {The varied effects of recent extreme weather events around the world exemplify the uneven impacts of climate change on populations, even within relatively small geographic regions. Differential human vulnerability to environmental hazards results from a range of social, economic, historical, and political factors, all of which operate at multiple scales. While adaptation to climate change has been the dominant focus of policy and research agendas, it is essential to ask as well why some communities and peoples are disproportionately exposed to and affected by climate threats. The cases and synthesis presented here are organized around four key themes (resource access, governance, culture, and knowledge), which we approach from four social science fields (cultural anthropology, archaeology, human geography, and sociology). Social scientific approaches to human vulnerability draw vital attention to the root causes of climate change threats and the reasons that people are forced to adapt to them. Because vulnerability is a multidimensional process rather than an unchanging state, a dynamic social approach to vulnerability is most likely to improve mitigation and adaptation planning efforts.

Thus, the main purpose of this paper was to review the literature and help researchers to understand the theoretical progress of pro-environmental behavior. This study systematically analyzed 1806 papers published in SCI-EXPANDED and SSCI databases. It presented the research overview of pro-environmental behavior in terms of status of literature publication, research hotspots and topics. On this basis, this paper further focused on key theoretical papers and summarized three paths of theoretical progress for pro-environmental behavior: theoretical development, theoretical exploration and theoretical integration. Along the theoretical development path, studies mainly apply theories of psychology, sociology and economics to analyze and explain the formation and consequences of pro-environmental behavior. In terms of theoretical exploration, existing studies propose and develop value-belief-norm theory, behavioral theories related to contexts and pro-environmental behavior decision models. Theoretical integration is the direction of future research, such as the combination of rationality and sensibility, and the combination of external and internal causes. Therefore, this paper summarized the theoretical progress of pro-environmental behavior and proposed future research directions, which contribute to its theoretical development.},

However, few studies have statistically investigated the relation between sustainability action taking and students' action competence. Recognising the importance of action taking in education for sustainable development, this study investigates school experiences in influencing society as one important aspect of sustainability teaching and learning that promotes students' action competence. We surveyed 902 students across three upper secondary schools situated within the same county municipality in Norway. One instrument measured the students' school experiences in influencing society, and another assessed the students' self-perceived action competence defined as i) knowledge of action possibilities, ii) confidence in one's own influence, and ii) willingness to act. A structural equation model showed that school experiences in influencing society have a positive relation with all the action competence factors, supporting previous research that highlights the importance of taking action with regard to sustainability as a part of education for sustainable development. The findings indicate that providing students with opportunities to influence society can foster their development of action competence for sustainability.},

  abstract = {The atmospheric and ocean environment has changed from human activities in ways that affect storms and extreme climate events. The main way climate change is perceived is through changes in extremes because those are outside the bounds of previous weather. The average anthropogenic climate change effect is not negligible, but nor is it large, although a small shift in the mean can lead to very large percentage changes in extremes. Anthropogenic global warming inherently has decadal time scales and can be readily masked by natural variability on short time scales. To the extent that interactions are linear, even places that feature below normal temperatures are still warmer than they otherwise would be. It is when natural variability and climate change develop in the same direction that records get broken. For instance, the rapid transition from El Ni{\~n}o prior to May 2010 to La Ni{\~n}a by July 2010 along with global warming contributed to the record high sea surface temperatures in the tropical Indian and Atlantic Oceans and in close proximity to places where record flooding subsequently occurred. A commentary is provided on recent climate extremes. The answer to the oft-asked question of whether an event is caused by climate change is that it is the wrong question. All weather events are affected by climate change because the environment in which they occur is warmer and moister than it used to be.},

  abstract = {A recent surge of research has investigated the potential of pro-environmental behavior interventions to affect other pro-environmental behaviors not initially targeted by the intervention. The evidence evaluating these spillover effects has been mixed, with some studies finding evidence for positive spillover (i.e., one pro-environmental behavior increases the likelihood of performing additional pro-environmental behaviors) and others finding negative spillover (i.e., one pro-environmental behavior decreases the likelihood of additional pro-environmental behaviors). Different academic disciplines have investigated this question, employing different methodologies and arriving at divergent findings. This paper provides a unifying theoretical framework and uses the framework to review the existing research on pro-environmental behavior spillover. Our framework identifies different decision modes as competing mechanisms that drive adoption of initial pro-environmental behaviors, with different consequences for subsequent pro-environmental behaviors, leading to positive, negative, or no spillover. Attribution of the initial pro-environmental behavior to either an external motivator (e.g., a price signal) or internal motivator (e.g., self-identity) also matters. In addition, the characteristics of and similarity between initial and subsequent pro-environmental behaviors can be expected to moderate predicted spillover effects. We explore the implications of our model for policymakers and practitioners, and suggest key areas where future research on the topic would be most beneficial.},

  abstract = {Encouraging pro-environmental behaviour (PEB) is an environmental and societal concern. Encouraging PEB focussing on how consumers see themselves (their identity) has blossomed. However, a theoretical assessment of this research is missing. Three main identity theories seem to best explain the research, specifically, and two-fold, identity, and social identity theory (SIT), collectively known as the unified identity theory (UIT), and place identity theory (PIT). As these theories overlap more than differ in their understanding of identity, we argue that combining these theories is needed to avoid redundancies in identity theorizing, provide a universal approach to identity in terms of the processes and outcomes, and explain the PEB research most succinctly. Therefore, we understand identity similarly between the theories and offer a universal identity theory approach based on the theoretical definitions and assumptions. Finally, we demonstrate how the theory can be used to explain the research. Next, research was identified by conducting a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, where 62 studies were relevant. Multiple identities relevant for a given PEB are assumed and evidenced: 99. Identities are assumed to be either individually-, group-, and/or place-focused, drawing on the specific subsets of the universal theory: identity theory, social identity theory, and place identity theory, respectively. Identities are assumed to relate to behaviour, where identity increased PEB with medium effect sizes. Finally, to move the field forward, we provide a theoretical framework of how to test identities in relation to other psychological variables relevant for PEB research.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Prolific research suggests identity associates with pro-environmental behaviours (PEBs) that are individual and/or group focused. Individual PEB is personally driven, self-reliant, and are conducted on one's own (e.g., home recycling). Group focused PEB is other people-reliant and completed as part of a group (e.g., attending meetings of an environmental organisation). A wide range of identities have been related to PEBs. For example, a recent systematic qualitative review revealed 99 different types of identities studied in a PEB context. Most studies were correlational, few had an experimental design. However, the relationships between all these identities and PEBs have so far not been tested quantitatively with meta-analytical techniques. As such, a clear overview of this field is currently lacking. Due to the diverse nature of the field, {$<$}italic{$>$}a priori{$<$}/italic{$>$} hypotheses were not possible and relatively broad definitions of identity had to be used to encompass all types of identities and the diverse meanings of identity that have been included in PEB research. What prior theory did allow for was to assess the distinction between two main types of identity, namely how people label, describe, and recognise oneself individually (individual identity), or as part of a group (group identity). Our overall goal was thus to assess the current state of knowledge on identities and PEBs. In 104 studies using a meta-regression following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines, our random-effects meta-analysis showed that the overall concept of identity associated with PEB with a medium Pearson's {$<$}italic{$>$}r{$<$}/italic{$>$} (Aim 1). Furthermore, we found that individual identities associated more strongly with PEBs than group identities (Aim 2). The associations between individual and group identities were stronger when the identity and PEB were from the same category (e.g., when both were group-focused; Aim 3). Methodologically, the findings revealed that group identities and group PEBs were most strongly associated for self-reported rather than observed PEBs (Aim 4). Overall identity associated most strongly with group PEBs in the field rather than in the lab (Aim 5) and in student- rather than non-student samples (Aim 6). We discuss the theoretical and practical implications.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

SEMM was proposed as a technique for the approximation of nonlinear latent variable relationships by finite mixtures of linear relationships (Bauer 2005, 2007; Bauer, Baldasaro, and Gottfredson 2012). In addition to this semiparametric approach to nonlinear latent variable modeling, there are numerous parametric nonlinear approaches for normally distributed variables (e.g., LMS in Mplus; Klein and Moosbrugger 2000). Recently, an additional semiparametric nonlinear structural equation mixture modeling (NSEMM) approach was proposed by Kelava, Nagengast, and Brandt (2014) that is capable of dealing with nonnormal predictors. In the nlsem package presented here, the SEMM, two distribution analytic (QML and LMS) and NSEMM approaches can be specified and estimated. We provide examples of how to use the package in the context of nonlinear latent variable modeling.},

  abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated a striking difference in climate change beliefs and policy support between people who identify with the right-wing of politics and with the left-wing of politics. But are we destined to continue with this divergence? We suggest that there is movement around these differences based on the politicization of climate change and we conducted two experimental studies with 126 and 646 people, respectively, to examine this effect. We found that those people whose political identity was made salient were less likely to believe in an anthropogenic cause of climate change and less likely to support government climate change policies than those whose identity was not made salient; particularly when those people were aligned with the right-wing of politics. The results demonstrate the importance of the salience of one's political identity in determining attitudes and beliefs even for scientific facts such as climate change. Our research also identifies some ways forward in dealing with climate change-based on depoliticizing the issue.},

We asked how belief in climate change, post-materialist values, trust and knowledge predict people's engagement in environmental action by testing two alternative structural equation models (SEM). In one of these models all these factors directly predicted climate-friendly action, and in the other the effect of political trust, postmaterialist values and climate change knowledge on climate-friendly action was mediated by belief in climate change. The models were tested with Eurobarometer 69.2 survey data of adult people living in Finland (N = 1,004). The SEM revealed that belief in climate change mediates the effect of post-material values, trust and knowledge on climate-friendly action. It is therefore important to recognize the role of belief in the public understanding of large-scale environmental problems. These results help political authorities to develop policies to encourage people's engagement in climate-friendly action.},

  abstract = {The goal of multiple imputation is to provide valid inferences for statistical estimates from incomplete data. To achieve that goal, imputed values should preserve the structure in the data, as well as the uncertainty about this structure, and include any knowledge about the process that generated the missing data. Two approaches for imputing multivariate data exist: joint modeling (JM) and fully conditional specification (FCS). JM is based on parametric statistical theory, and leads to imputation procedures whose statistical properties are known. JM is theoretically sound, but the joint model may lack flexibility needed to represent typical data features, potentially leading to bias. FCS is a semi-parametric and flexible alternative that specifies the multivariate model by a series of conditional models, one for each incomplete variable. FCS provides tremendous flexibility and is easy to apply, but its statistical properties are difficult to establish. Simulation work shows that FCS behaves very well in the cases studied. The present paper reviews and compares the approaches. JM and FCS were applied to pubertal development data of 3801 Dutch girls that had missing data on menarche (two categories), breast development (five categories) and pubic hair development (six stages). Imputations for these data were created under two models: a multivariate normal model with rounding and a conditionally specified discrete model. The JM approach introduced biases in the reference curves, whereas FCS did not. The paper concludes that FCS is a useful and easily applied flexible alternative to JM when no convenient and realistic joint distribution can be specified.},

Despite a long-standing recognition of the importance of ECEs by paleo-ecologists and macro-evolutionary biologists, ECEs have only recently received a strong interest in the wider ecological and evolutionary community. However, as with many rapidly expanding fields, it lacks structure and cohesiveness, which strongly limits scientific progress. Furthermore, due to the descriptive and anecdotal nature of many ECE studies it is still unclear what the most relevant questions and long-term consequences are of ECEs. To improve synthesis, we first discuss ways to define ECEs that facilitate comparison among studies. We then argue that biologists should adhere to more rigorous attribution and mechanistic methods to assess ECE impacts. Subsequently, we discuss conceptual and methodological links with climatology and disturbance-, tipping point- and paleo-ecology. These research fields have close linkages with ECE research, but differ in the identity and/or the relative severity of environmental factors. By summarizing the contributions to this theme issue we draw parallels between behavioural, ecological and evolutionary ECE studies, and suggest that an overarching challenge is that most empirical and theoretical evidence points towards responses being highly idiosyncratic, and thus predictability being low. Finally, we suggest a roadmap based on the proposition that an increased focus on the mechanisms behind the biological response function will be crucial for increased understanding and predictability of the impacts of ECE.

  abstract = {Examining the conceptual relationship between personal experience, affect, and risk perception is crucial in improving our understanding of how emotional and cognitive process mechanisms shape public perceptions of climate change. This study is the first to investigate the interrelated nature of these variables by contrasting three prominent social-psychological theories. In the first model, affect is viewed as a fast and associative information processing heuristic that guides perceptions of risk. In the second model, affect is seen as flowing from cognitive appraisals (i.e., affect is thought of as a post-cognitive process). Lastly, a third, dual-process model is advanced that integrates aspects from both theoretical perspectives. Four structural equation models were tested on a national sample (N = 808) of British respondents. Results initially provide support for the ``cognitive'' model, where personal experience with extreme weather is best conceptualized as a predictor of climate change risk perception and, in turn, risk perception a predictor of affect. Yet, closer examination strongly indicates that at the same time, risk perception and affect reciprocally influence each other in a stable feedback system. It is therefore concluded that both theoretical claims are valid and that a dual-process perspective provides a superior fit to the data. Implications for theory and risk communication are discussed. {\copyright} 2014 The Authors. European Journal of Social Psychology published by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Experiential and socio-cultural factors explained significantly more variance in risk perception than either cognitive or socio-demographic characteristics.

Instead, it involves the necessity of parameter linking due to a fundamental problem inherent in the formal nature of these models---their general lack of identifiability. More specifically, item response model parameters need to be linked to adjust for the different effects of the identifiability restrictions used in separate item calibrations. Our main theorems characterize the formal nature of these linking functions for monotone, continuous response models, derive their specific shapes for different parameterizations of the 3PL model, and show how to identify them from the parameter values of the common items or persons in different linking designs.},

As such, greater knowledge of social dilemmas should help us understand not only the theoretical puzzles of why people cooperate (or not) but also the ways in which cooperation in groups and organizations can be maintained or promoted. This article reviews different types of social dilemmas, highlights recent developments in the field (especially within psychology), and suggests some new avenues for future research. We illustrate that the field of social dilemma is growing and flourishing in terms of theory, interdisciplinary collaboration, and applicability, producing insights that are novel, replicable, and applicable to many social situations where short-term self-interest is at odds with the long-term interests of teams, organizations, or nations.},

First, borders of thought could be crossed by using persuasion that is concrete and tailored to local circumstances and by highlighting information about people's efforts as evidence against the myth of self-interest. Second, borders of time could be crossed by using kinship cues, which can help make the future less distant, and relatively uninvolved advisors, who may help make the future salient. And third, borders of space could be crossed by showing group representatives how they might benefit from a frame of altruistic competition---focusing on the benefits of being seen as moral and global in orientation.

In contrast, knowledge and experience, which are often assumed to be key barriers to adaptation, were relatively weakly related to adaptation. Research has disproportionally focused on studying experience and risk perception, flooding and hurricanes, and preparedness behaviours, while other motivational factors, hazards and adaptive behaviours have been understudied.

Previous studies provided inconclusive results on the relationship between climate change perceptions and adaptation behavior. Using a longitudinal approach, we examined whether risk perception, self-efficacy, and outcome efficacy play a role in how and when climate change perceptions are associated with adaptation to pluvial flooding and heat stress in the Netherlands. As expected, stronger climate change perceptions were associated with stronger perceptions of climate-related risks, which in turn lead to stronger intentions to implement adaptation measures. Yet, neither climate change perceptions nor risk perception were associated with whether people had actually implemented adaptation measures during a 1-year period. Contrary to common assumptions in the literature, higher levels of perceived self-efficacy and outcome efficacy did not strengthen the relations between climate change perceptions and adaptation intentions and behavior. Rather, higher levels of self-efficacy and outcome efficacy were directly related to stronger intentions to take adaptive measures and taking those measures within a period of 1 year. Exploratory analyses offered initial support for a sequential model where climate change perceptions lead to higher levels of perceptions of specific climate-related risks, which in turn lead to stronger self-efficacy and outcome efficacy, ultimately increasing adaptation intentions, but not actual behavior. Strategies to promote adaptation behavior could aim to remove behavioral barriers to increase self-efficacy, and strengthen outcome efficacy, enabling people to act on their climate change perceptions.},

  abstract = {The use of surveys, questionnaires, and rating scales to measure important outcomes in higher education is pervasive, but reliability and validity information is often based on problematic Classical Test Theory approaches. Rasch Analysis, based on Item Response Theory, provides a better alternative for examining the psychometric quality of rating scales and informing scale improvements. This paper outlines a six-step process for using Rasch Analysis to review the psychometric properties of a rating scale. The Partial Credit Model and Andrich Rating Scale Model will be described in terms of the pyschometric information (i.e., reliability, validity, and item difficulty) and diagnostic indices generated. Further, this approach will be illustrated through the example of authentic data from a university-wide student evaluation of teaching.},

  abstract = {Critics of positive psychology have questioned the validity of positive psychological assessment measures (PPAMs), which negatively affects the credibility and public perception of the discipline. Psychometric evaluations of PPAMs have shown that various instruments produce inconsistent factor structures between groups/contexts/times frames, that their predictive validity is questionable, and that popular PPAMs are culturally biased. Further, it would seem positive psychological researchers prioritize date-model-fit over measurement quality. To address these analytical challenges, more innovative and robust approaches toward the validation and evaluation of PPAMs are required to enhance the discipline's credibility and to advance positive psychological science. Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM) has recently emerged as a promising alternative to overcome some of these challenges by incorporating the best elements from exploratory- and confirmatory factor analyses. ESEM is still a relatively novel approach, and estimating these models in statistical software packages can be complex and tedious. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide novice researchers with a practical tutorial on how to estimate ESEM with a convenient online tool for Mplus. Specifically, we aim to demonstrate the use of ESEM through an illustrative example by using a popular positive psychological instrument: the Mental Health Continuum-SF. By using the MHC-SF as an example, we aim to provide (a) a brief overview of ESEM (and different ESEM models/approaches), (b) guidelines for novice researchers on how to estimate, compare, report, and interpret ESEM, and (c) a step-by-step tutorial on how to run ESEM analyses in Mplus with the De Beer and Van Zy ESEM syntax generator. The results of this study highlight the value of ESEM, over and above that of traditional confirmatory factor analytical approaches. The results also have practical implications for measuring mental health with the MHC-SF, illustrating that a bifactor ESEM Model fits the data significantly better than any other theoretical model.},

To produce evidence for or against this assumption, we conducted meta-analyses of correlations between social desirability scales and self-reports of environmentally relevant behaviors, intentions, and (broadly defined) attitudes, based on data from 29 previously published papers. The pooled correlations with social desirability are generally small, ranging from 0.06 to 0.11 (0.08--0.13 when correcting for measurement error attenuation). However, our results do not lead to the conclusion that social desirability can be completely disregarded by environmental psychologists as a potential confounder. For example, we found evidence of substantial heterogeneity across studies, so the effect of social desirability may be more pronounced in specific cases. Continued attention to social desirability bias is needed to fully understand its possible subtle effects.},

  abstract = {The most accurate width measurements in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) require raw images to be corrected for instrumental artifacts. Corrections are based upon a physical model that describes the sample-instrument interaction. Models differ in their approaches or approximations in the treatment of scattering cross sections, secondary electron (SE) generation, material properties, scattering at the surface potential barrier, etc. Corrections that use different models produce different width estimates. We have implemented eight models in the JMONSEL SEM simulator. Two are phenomenological models based upon fitting measured yield vs. energy curves. Two are based upon a binary scattering model. Four are variants of a dielectric function approach. These models are compared to each other in pairwise simulations in which the output of one model is fit to the other by using adjustable parameters similar to those used to fit measured data. The differences in their edge position parameters is then a measure of how much these models differ with respect to a width measurement. With electron landing energy, beam width, and other parameters typical of those used in industrial critical dimension measurements, the models agreed to within {\textpm}2.0 nm on silicon and {\textpm}2.6 nm on copper in 95\% of comparisons.},

However, it is unclear which strategies are most likely to motivate people to change their climate beliefs and behaviors. Here, we tested 11 expert-crowdsourced interventions on four climate mitigation outcomes: beliefs, policy support, information sharing intention, and an effortful tree-planting behavioral task. Across 59,440 participants from 63 countries, the interventions' effectiveness was small, largely limited to nonclimate skeptics, and differed across outcomes: Beliefs were strengthened mostly by decreasing psychological distance (by 2.3\%), policy support by writing a letter to a future-generation member (2.6\%), information sharing by negative emotion induction (12.1\%), and no intervention increased the more effortful behavior---several interventions even reduced tree planting. Last, the effects of each intervention differed depending on people's initial climate beliefs. These findings suggest that the impact of behavioral climate interventions varies across audiences and target behaviors.},

There is a growing literature examining the psychological determinants of various climate adaptation strategies among smallholder farmers but little attention to how psychological factors vary across adaptation decisions and the underlying motivations for these decisions. We assess climate adaptation in terms of five risk management categories outlined by Agrawal (2009). Using a sample of farming households in Kenya (N\,=\,494), we find that while 98\% of smallholders believe that various dimensions of climate change pose a significant threat to their livelihood, these beliefs do not necessarily translate into climate actions. Results show that environmental concerns are not salient motivators for or against adaptation strategies, but food insecurity and household expenses are, suggesting a disconnect between climate beliefs and actions. Future research on decision-making related to climate adaptation within semi-arid agroecosystems should consider that while perceptions of climate change are important in shaping climate adaptive actions, they are not necessarily a salient motivator. Climate change is predicted to have significant negative impacts on food security but concerns about food security are what motivate farmers to adopt practices that will prepare them for climate change.},

Furthermore, through principle component analysis a particular dimension of pro-environmental behavior is identified so as to produce more robust and consistent results. Social structural context and self-efficacy are found to be powerful mediators of the relationship between environmental concern and pro-environmental behavior. Lastly, social structural context, as measured by the availability of curbside recycling, is shown to act as a gateway to additional pro-environmental behaviors beyond recycling.},

  abstract = {Current research shows that emotions can motivate climate engagement and action, but precisely how has received scant attention. We propose that strong emotional responses to climate change result from perceiving one's ``objects of care'' as threatened by climate change, which motivates caring about climate change itself, and in turn predicts behaviour. In two studies, we find that climate scientists (N\,=\,44) experience greater emotional intensity about climate change than do students (N\,=\,94) and the general population (N\,=\,205), and that patterns of emotional responses explain differences in support for climate change policy. Scientists tied their emotional responses to concern about consequences of climate change to future generations and the planet, as well as personal identities associated with responsibility to act. Our findings suggest that ``objects of care'' that link people to climate change may be crucial to understanding why some people feel more strongly about the issue than others, and how emotions can prompt action.},

Errors in measures as a result of self-reporting occurred, ranging between 10.5\% and 12.6\% and 24.6\% and 29.3\%, depending upon fuel type and respondents' use of household receipts. There was no apparent tendency toward systematic over-or underreporting, with the exception of underreporting among larger users. Selfreports correlated more highly with actual consumption than did scores computed to replace missing data. Relationships among variables did not vary significantly between subgroups of respondents for which utility records were and were not obtained. It is concluded that no great error is introduced into findings by researchers' use of self-reports of household energy consumption, either in terms of parameter estimation or in the calculation of relationships among variables. At the sametime, use of self-reports allows the number of missing observations to be reduced.},

Reviews of the professional literature have consistently found that many applications of EFA are marked by an injudicious choice of methods and incomplete reports.

  abstract = {It should come as no surprise that the governments and citizenries of many countries show little concern about climate change and its consequences. Behavioral decision research over the last 30 years provides a series of lessons about the importance of affect in perceptions of risk and in decisions to take actions that reduce or manage perceived risks. Evidence from a range of domains suggests that worry drives risk management decisions. When people fail to be alarmed about a risk or hazard, they do not take precautions. Recent personal experience strongly influences the evaluation of a risky option. Low-probability events generate less concern than their probability warrants on average, but more concern than they deserve in those rare instances when they do occur. Personal experience with noticeable and serious consequences of global warming is still rare in many regions of the world. When people base their decisions on statistical descriptions about a hazard provided by others, characteristics of the hazard identified as psychological risk dimensions predict differences in alarm or worry across different classes of risk. The time-delayed, abstract, and often statistical nature of the risks of global warming does not evoke strong visceral reactions. These results suggest that we should find ways to evoke visceral reactions towards the risk of global warming, perhaps by simulations of its concrete future consequences for people's home or other regions they visit or value. Increased concern about global warming needs to solicited carefully, however, to prevent a decrease in concern about other relevant risks. The generation of worry or concern about global warming may be a necessary but not sufficient condition for desirable or appropriate protective or mitigating behavior on part of the general public.},

This has led to a focus on suboptimal intervention strategies, particularly informational approaches. Addressing the climate crisis requires a focus on~high-impact behaviours and high-emitting groups; interdisciplinary interventions that address the multiple drivers, barriers and contexts of behaviour; and timing to ensure interventions are targeted to moments of change when habits are weaker.},

We estimate that land use change has affected almost a third (32\%) of the global land area in just six decades (1960-2019) and, thus, is around four times greater in extent than previously estimated from long-term land change assessments. We also identify geographically diverging land use change processes, with afforestation and cropland abandonment in the Global North and deforestation and agricultural expansion in the South. Here, we show that observed phases of accelerating ({\textasciitilde}1960--2005) and decelerating (2006--2019) land use change can be explained by the effects of global trade on agricultural production.},

This experience may be associated with attributions to climate change, as well as with pro-environmental attitudes and behavioral intentions. Given the United States' (US) recent devastating wildfires and widespread coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we conducted two national surveys (study 1: n~=~502, study 2: n~=~1,493) of US adults examining how subjective attribution is associated with personal experience with extremes, as well as with concern and subjective knowledge about climate change. We also examine the extent to which these factors are associated with pro-environmental attitudes and behavioral intentions, and whether these relationships are amplified or attenuated by subjective attribution. We find that personal experience, concern, and subjective knowledge are associated with the belief that wildfires and COVID-19 are attributable to climate change. These in turn are all associated with pro-environmental attitudes (carbon tax policy support) and behavioral intentions (electric vehicle purchase). Subjective attribution of COVID-19 amplifies the positive relationship between personal experience with COVID-19 and electric vehicle purchase intentions (study 1 and 2), and subjective attribution of wildfire or COVID-19 amplifies the positive relationship between subjective knowledge and carbon tax policy support (study 2). These findings highlight the importance of personal experience and subjective attributions as they relate to individuals' intentions to perform pro-environmental actions and support policy.},

Escalating extreme weather events increase the number of those directly exposed and adversely impacted by climate change. But do people attribute these negative events to climate change? Such subjective attribution may be a cognitive process whereby the experience of negative climate-change-related events may increase risk perceptions and motivate people to act. Here we surveyed a representative sample of 1846 residents of Florida and Texas, many of whom had been repeatedly exposed to hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, facing the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season. We assessed prior hurricane negative personal experiences, climate-change-related subjective attribution (for hurricanes), risk appraisal (perceived probability and severity of a hurricane threat), hurricane adaptation appraisal (perceived efficacy of adaptation measures and self-efficacy to address the threat of hurricanes), and self-reported hurricane personal household adaptation. Our findings suggest that prior hurricane negative personal experiences and subjective attribution are associated with greater hurricane risk appraisal. Hurricane subjective attribution moderated the relationship between hurricane negative personal experiences and risk appraisal; in turn, negative hurricane personal experiences, hurricane risk appraisal, and adaptation appraisal were positively associated with self-reported hurricane personal adaptation behaviors. Subjective attribution may be associated with elevated perceived risk for specific climate hazards. Communications that help people understand the link between their negative personal experiences (e.g. hurricanes) and climate change may help guide risk perceptions and motivate protective actions, particularly in areas with repeated exposure to threats.},

For ordered categorical data, unweighted least squares (ULS) and diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) based on polychoric correlation matrices have been recommended in previous studies. Although no clear suggestions exist regarding the application of these fit indices when analyzing ordered categorical variables, practitioners are still tempted to adopt the conventional cutoff rules. The purpose of our research was to answer the question: Given a population polychoric correlation matrix and a hypothesized model, if ML results in a specific RMSEA value (e.g., .08), what is the RMSEA value when ULS or DWLS is applied? CFI and TLI were investigated in the same fashion. Both simulated and empirical polychoric correlation matrices with various degrees of model misspecification were employed to address the above question. The results showed that DWLS and ULS lead to smaller RMSEA and larger CFI and TLI values than does ML for all manipulated conditions, regardless of whether or not the indices are scaled. Applying the conventional cutoffs to DWLS and ULS, therefore, has a pronounced tendency not to discover model--data misfit. Discussions regarding the use of RMSEA, CFI, and TLI for ordered categorical data are given.},

General hazard and temperature anomalies experiences have significant correlations, but other events exhibit no or neglectable effects. The moderator analysis showed that self-reported studies result in higher correlations, whereas studies based on victims' actual experiences report lower effect sizes. Our study suggests that people's climate change experiences may not be effective in shaping their awareness of climate change, which is likely due to people's attribution style and adaptability. The importance of proactive education thus is further emphasized to raise the awareness of climate change.},

However, no universally consistent heatwave definition is available. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the heatwave definitions used in the literature published up to 1st April 2015 by searching five databases (PubMed, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science). Random-effects models were used to pool the effects of heatwave on total and cardiorespiratory mortality by different heatwave definitions. Existing evidence suggests a significant impact of heatwave on mortality, but the magnitude of the effect estimates varies under different heatwave definitions. Heatwave-related mortality risks increased by 4\% (using ``mean temperatures {$\geq$}95th percentile for {$\geq$}2days'' as a heatwave definition), 3\% (mean temperatures {$\geq$}98th percentile for {$\geq$}2days), 7\% (mean temperatures {$\geq$}99th percentile for {$\geq$}2days) and 16\% (mean temperatures {$\geq$}97th percentile for {$\geq$}5days). Heatwave intensity plays a relatively more important role than duration in determining heatwave-related deaths. Heatwaves significantly increase mortality across the globe, but the effect estimates vary with the definition of heatwaves.

This study aimed to investigate whether temperature observation time and type influenced the assessment of heatwave impact on morbidity, to assess how heatwave duration modified heatwave impact on morbidity, and to examine whether there was a consistent temperature threshold beyond which five different types of health events increased sharply. Methods Minutely air temperature data in Brisbane, Australia, were collected and converted into five daily temperature indicators observed at different time points or calculated using different approaches. Twenty-nine heatwave definitions for each temperature indicator were used to examine the effects of heatwaves on five health events (i.e., ambulance service uses, emergency department attendances (EDAs), hospitalizations, possible EDAs of heat and/or dehydration, and possible hospitalizations of heat and/or dehydration) by quasi-Poisson models. Results Mean temperature was slightly better than maximum temperature in predicting heatwave impact on morbidity (P{$<$}0.05), and no appreciable difference in model performance was observed amongst different mean temperature indicators. Two-day-duration heatwaves were more detrimental than longer-lasting heatwaves when heatwave intensity was not high, and 97th percentile appeared to be a consistent temperature threshold for most heatwave-related health events (P{$<$}0.05). Conclusions It seems desirable in the development of heatwave definition and early warning systems to use mean temperature as an exposure indicator, and to adopt the 97th percentile of temperature as the trigger in Brisbane. Health sectors need to better prepare for short-lasting heatwaves.},

The results support the utility of the RISP model in predicting risk information seeking and systematic processing. However, the model demonstrated limited explanatory power for heuristic processing. A reduced model composed of only 2 variables---current knowledge and informational subjective norms---accounted for a substantial proportion of variance in the outcome variables. This more parsimonious explanation of information seeking and systematic processing might extend the utility of the RISP model to other communication settings not related to risk. Theoretical boundaries of the RISP model and implications for future research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Survey and longitudinal studies in the social and behavioral sciences generally contain missing data. Mean and covariance structure models play an important role in analyzing such data. Two promising methods for dealing with missing data are a direct maximum-likelihood and a two-stage approach based on the unstructured mean and covariance estimates obtained by the EM-algorithm. Typical assumptions under these two methods are ignorable nonresponse and normality of data. However, data sets in social and behavioral sciences are seldom normal, and experience with these procedures indicates that normal theory based methods for nonnormal data very often lead to incorrect model evaluations. By dropping the normal distribution assumption, we develop more accurate procedures for model inference. Based on the theory of generalized estimating equations, a way to obtain consistent standard errors of the two-stage estimates is given. The asymptotic efficiencies of different estimators are compared under various assumptions. We also propose a minimum chi-square approach and show that the estimator obtained by this approach is asymptotically at least as efficient as the two likelihood-based estimators for either normal or nonnormal data. The major contribution of this paper is that for each estimator, we give a test statistic whose asymptotic distribution is chisquare as long as the underlying sampling distribution enjoys finite fourth-order moments. We also give a characterization for each of the two likelihood ratio test statistics when the underlying distribution is nonnormal. Modifications to the likelihood ratio statistics are also given. Our working assumption is that the missing data mechanism is missing completely at random. Examples and Monte Carlo studies indicate that, for commonly encountered nonnormal distributions, the procedures developed in this paper are quite reliable even for samples with missing data that are missing at random.},

A sandwich-type covariance matrix is used to obtain consistent standard errors (SE) of the structural parameter estimates. Rescaled, adjusted as well as corrected and F-statistics are proposed for overall model evaluation. Using R and EQS, the R package rsem combines the two stages and generates all the test statistics and consistent SEs. Following the robust analysis, multiple model fit indices and standardized solutions are provided in the corresponding output of EQS. An example with open/closed book examination data illustrates the proper use of the package. The method is further applied to the analysis of a data set from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 cohort, and results show that the developed procedure not only gives a better endorsement of the substantive models but also yields estimates with uniformly smaller standard errors than the normal-distribution-based maximum likelihood.},

The effect of nonnormally distributed data or data contamination on the normal-distribution-based likelihood ratio (LR) statistic is well understood due to many analytical and empirical studies. In SEM, fit indices are used as widely as the LR statistic. In addition to NML, robust procedures have been developed for more efficient and less biased parameter estimates with practical data. This article studies the effect of outliers and leverage observations on fit indices following NML and two robust methods. Analysis and empirical results indicate that good leverage observations following NML and one of the robust methods lead most fit indices to give more support to the substantive model. While outliers tend to make a good model superficially bad according to many fit indices following NML, they have little effect on those following the two robust procedures. Implications of the results to data analysis are discussed, and recommendations are provided regarding the use of estimation methods and interpretation of fit indices.

  abstract = {Multigroup structural equation modeling (SEM) plays a key role in studying measurement invariance and in group comparison. When population covariance matrices are deemed not equal across groups, the next step to substantiate measurement invariance is to see whether the sample covariance matrices in all the groups can be adequately fitted by the same factor model, called configural invariance. After configural invariance is established, cross-group equalities of factor loadings, error variances, and factor variancescovariances are then examined in sequence. With mean structures, cross-group equalities of intercepts and factor means are also examined. The established rule is that if the statistic at the current model is not significant at the level of .05, one then moves on to testing the next more restricted model using a chi-square-difference statistic. This article argues that such an established rule is unable to control either Type I or Type II errors. Analysis, an example, and Monte Carlo results show why and how chi-squaredifference tests are easily misused. The fundamental issue is that chi-square-difference tests are developed under the assumption that the base model is sufficiently close to the population, and a nonsignificant chi-square statistic tells little about how good the model is. To overcome this issue, this article further proposes that null hypothesis testing in multigroup SEM be replaced by equivalence testing, which allows researchers to effectively control the size of misspecification before moving on to testing a more restricted model. R code is also provided to facilitate the applications of equivalence testing for multigroup SEM.},

  abstract = {The theory of planned behavior (TPB) allows researchers to identify the determinants of environmental behavior and subsequently target these factors in interventions. Multiple studies on conservation behaviors have recently applied this theoretical framework in both organizational and domestic settings. To shed more light on how the TPB was used in these studies, we conducted a literature review with the following objectives: 1) explore which individual green behaviors were studied though the lens of the TPB, 2) understand how scholars have used the theory and what variance the theory has helped to explain, and 3) formulate recommendations, if necessary, for improving the use of the theory. The review of the results from 126 publications demonstrated that the majority of scholars tend to overlook the importance of identifying and evaluating indirect variables (beliefs) that affect behaviors. More than half of the analyzed articles did not report the amount of explained variance, which undermines the principal strength of the theory. Scholars could obtain more substantial and consistent results if the guidelines regarding the application of the theory are consistently respected. More specifically, four aspects should be considered in the application of the theory: choice of framework, decision to extend the original model, methodology, and results. To help scholars overcome these commonly encountered problems, this article suggests a roadmap with several guiding questions and possible answers.},

Spatial data are used to analyze multiple measures of climate change vulnerability along with demographic, attitudinal, and perception-based variables derived from a representative national survey of U.S. residents to predict variation in support for interventionist climate change policies. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression results show that objective risk measures explain a modest amount of variation in our dependent variable. The effect of risk perception on climate policy support is far more robust. Of all variables examined, the extent to which citizens regard climate change as threatening to their material well-being drives support for costly climate change policies.},

A remaining question is whether the experience of an extreme weather event increases climate change concern via experiential learning or reinforces existing views via motivated reasoning. Building on this work, we explore the relationship between personal experience and climate change policy preferences using surveys in 10 communities that experienced extreme weather events (3 tornadoes, 3 floods, 2 wildfires, 1 hurricane and 1 landslide). We find that self-reported personal harm aligns with objective measures of event impacts and that personal harm (i.e., experience) is associated with higher levels of policy support. However, we do not find that objective measures of event impacts are related to policy support. Though political ideology (i.e., motivated reasoning) dominates our model of policy support in predictable ways, personal harm moderates this relationship suggesting that conservatives reporting higher levels of personal harm from the event are, on average, more likely to express support for climate policy than those reporting lower levels of harm. We postulate that while extreme weather events may serve as teachable moments on climate change, their lessons may only reach conservatives who feel personally harmed, even in the communities most affected.},

We find that an overwhelming majority (86\%) of the U.S. public reported being at least slightly impacted by an extreme weather event, and one-third (34\%) reported being either very or extremely impacted by one or more types of extreme weather events. We clustered respondents into four impact groups, representing a composite of self-reported impacts from multiple types of extreme weather events. Respondents in the highest extreme weather impact group are more than 2.5 times as likely to identify as Black or Hispanic and 1.89 times more likely to live in a household with income levels below the Federal poverty level. We also observe reports of higher extreme weather impacts from respondents who are female, do not have a bachelor's degree and live in a rural area. Our results indicate that extreme weather impacts are being felt by a broad cross-section of the U.S. public, with the highest impacts being disproportionately reported by populations that have previously been found to be more vulnerable to natural disasters and other extreme events.},

Although individuals can choose from a variety of emotion regulation strategies, some strategies have been found to thwart pro-environmental behavior. In a series of experimental studies, we examined the emotion regulation potential of pro-environmental behavior itself. Participants in exploratory Studies 1a and 1b were presented a text about the loss of biodiversity and then decided how much time to spend on an effort task that yields donations to an environmental organization. More pro-environmental behavior was associated with an increase in hope and a decrease in fear in both studies and a decrease in guilt in Study 1b. However, more pro-environmental behavior was confounded with a greater time interval between emotional ratings. In preregistered Study 2, we controlled for possible cool-down effects by having participants complete a time-limited task that would either yield donations to an environmental organization or have no pro-environmental consequences after reading the biodiversity text. Similar to Studies 1a and 1b, participants in the pro-environmental behavior group compared to the control group reported a stronger increase in hope. However, both groups reported a similar decrease in fear and guilt. Consistent with previous research, pro-environmental behavior seems especially effective in upregulating positive emotions. Drawing hope from pro-environmental behavior while maintaining a certain level of concern and responsibility is discussed as an adaptive emotional response to environmental threat.},

  abstract = {This study advances theory articulating the micro-level processes behind public organization adaptation to extreme weather. It tackles a persistent puzzle about the limited adaptation to extreme weather among public organizations: why does adaptation remain deficit after public organizations have experienced repeated extreme weather and some catastrophic consequences? We develop a computational agent-based model that integrates extant theory and data from semi-structured interviews of U.S. public transit agency managers, and use the model to investigate how micro-level cognition and behavior interact with environmental constraints to facilitate or impede the diffusion of adaptation. We articulate in greater detail how experience with influential extreme weather events matters to adaptation, highlighting that such experience is insufficient for adaptation to occur. A key insight is that the potential benefits from both increased risk perception and additional financial resources stemming from disaster- or non-disaster-induced opportunities can be underutilized, absent effective coupling between heightened risk perception and availability of resources that creates windows for adaptation. Using this insight, we further identify managerial and policy interventions with maximum leverage to promote adaptation to extreme weather in public organizations. The experiments show that slowing risk perception decay and synchronizing opportunities with extreme weather occurrences can stimulate adaptation.},

Data from the science module of the 2006 General Social Survey were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results offered support for the reinforcing spirals model's predictions. Media use mediated the effects of age, race, and education on perceived knowledge about global warming. Perceived knowledge and concern over global warming also predicted future information seeking about the polar regions.},
