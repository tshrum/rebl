Principal Investigator (PI): Dr. Trisha R. Shrum

Introduction

You are being invited to take part in this research study because we want to understand recent daily habits and consumer behavior of adults in the US. This study is being conducted by Dr. Shrum at the University of Vermont.



Purpose

The purpose of this survey is to help develop a behavioral scale to better understand motivations for consumer behavior.



Study Procedures

If you take part in the study, you will be asked to take a survey. 

The survey questions ask whether or not you have done a large number of common consumer behaviors in the past week. We will also ask a series of questions about your attitudes and experience with weather events. Finally, we will ask for the location of your primary residence. 

You can skip attitude and location questions that you do not feel comfortable answering, but we ask that you be as thorough and accurate as possible. The study will take about 12 minutes to complete in a single session.



Benefits

As a participant in this research study, there may not be direct benefit for you; however, information from this study may benefit other people now or in the future.



Risks

Your participation in this study involves minimal foreseeable risks. Your address is considered identifiable information, but you can skip the question if you are not comfortable sharing it. You are also not required to provide your exact address, but we ask that you be as accurate as possible.

We will do our best to protect the information we collect from you and avoid any potential risk for an accidental breach of confidentiality. 



Costs 

There will be no costs to you for participation in this research study.



Compensation

For taking part in this research study, you will be reimbursed for your time as specified in the Prolific recruitment process.



Confidentiality
Addresses are the only identifying information we will be collecting. However, you can skip the question if you are not comfortable. You also do not need to provide an exact address, but we ask that you be as accurate as possible. 

To protect the confidentiality of respondents, addresses will be stored in a folder with restricted access and will be kept separate from other survey and demographic information.
